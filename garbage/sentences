Fishing in a mountain stream is my idea of a good time.

After the dance, they went straight home.
The hostess taught the new maid to serve.

Adding fast leads to wrong sums.
The show was a flop from the very start.

There was water in the cellar after that heavy rain.
They're not listed in the new phone book.

A large size in stockings is hard to sell.
The juice of lemons makes fine punch.

Smoke poured out of every crack.
Serve the hot rum to the tired heroes.

Those words were the cue for the actor to leave.
A yacht slid around the point into the bay.

The play seems dull and quite stupid.
Thieves who rob friends deserve jail.

The frosty air passed through the coat.
The crooked maze failed to fool the mouse.

He wrote his last novel there at the inn.
Even the worst will beat his low score.

A saw is a tool used for making boards.
The wagon moved on well oiled wheels.

Try to have the court decide the case.
They are pushed back each time they attack.

The box was thrown beside the parked truck.
The hogs were fed chopped corn and garbage.

much of the story
sun came up to light

two met while playing on the sand
ink stain dried

taste of cheese
act on these orders

adding fast wrong sums
show was a flop

cement had dried
loss of the second ship

march the soliders
sugar makes sweet fudge

broke his ties
sun their white backs

chicken leg
rice served in round bowls

desk was firm
heat to bring out the odor

town was siezed without a fight
lease ran out

purple tie ten years
men think and plan

saw is a tool
wagon moved on well oiled wheels

torn scraps
sunday is the best part

cars busses satalled
set of china

map had an x
whitings

boy was there when the sun rose
rod is used to catch pink salmon

beef is scarcer
raise sail and steer

tame squirrel
sleeping cop

sliced the sausage
bloom of the rose

march the soldiers
sweet fudge

birds in wool cloth
fairytales should be fun

he knew the skill
shower of dirt

wrec ocurred by the bank
black lead writes best

simple to my mind
adored men

odor of spring
crack the walnut

we talked of the sideshow
use a pencil to write

bail the boat
torm ended in late june

januitor sweeps the floor
easier if people woudl help

the fruit peel was cut in thick slices
i don't want to go to the movies

don't try and get out of it
there isn't enough paint

coax young calf
schools for ladies

be very quiet
nothing to be seen
