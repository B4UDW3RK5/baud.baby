A  lone scribe  mumbles in a dark the corner  of  the library, scowling at the
text he's been tasked to decipher.

"Foretold," he  reads aloud, pen  committing his translation to  parchment, "A
time of change. A new place. No, a new kingdom."

Welcome, traveller, to the Kingdom of Soft Ash!

Thank  you to everyone who tuned in live for the first entry in an exploration
of dungeon synth.  This show is a selecton of tracks from the grandfathers  of
the genre.
