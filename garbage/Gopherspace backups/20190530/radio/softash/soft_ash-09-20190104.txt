First Soft Ash of 2019! A nice  mix of neofolk, the  show is pretty mellow and
low-energy but that's the nature of the genre.

There was a hiccup about half way through so  the  archive is  split in  half,
hopefully they  should still work  but I haven't listened back through them to
check.

As always; thank you so much to everyone who  tuned in  live, this year I hope
to see Tildeverse Radio really gain some traction.
