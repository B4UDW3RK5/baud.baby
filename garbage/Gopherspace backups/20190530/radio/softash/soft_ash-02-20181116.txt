Thirteen post-punk  and  darkwave tracks  from  artists  that are new  to  me,
including a  couple  of  fantastic  Australian acts. I've found a  lot  of new
things to love this last few weeks and hope I've helped you find some too.

Unfortunately there was a hiccup with the archiver for this one so no archive,
if you missed it you missed it  but the setlist is below so check out a few of
the artists, I highly recommend all of them.
