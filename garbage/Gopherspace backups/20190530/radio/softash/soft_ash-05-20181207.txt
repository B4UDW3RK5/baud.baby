I can't believe this took me so long to put up, I just kept putting it off and
did other things. Belated thank you to everyone who tuned in for this  show, I
played mostly heavy shoegaze, doomgaze, slugdgegaze, whatever you want to call
it. I think I short circuited and paused the playing deck at one point but eh,
it's all  good fun.  If you missed  it live, the archive should be linked from
the main softash/ gophermap.

After Soft Ash I stayed on the mountpoint because there's no show  after  mine
anymore and played nerdcore hip hop for a couple hours, you can check that out
in the archives too if you like!
