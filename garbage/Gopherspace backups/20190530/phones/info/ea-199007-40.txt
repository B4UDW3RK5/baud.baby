NEW MODEL TOUCHFONE

Alcatel STC  is  apparently  readying  a  new version  of the  Australian  made
Touchfone, to be known as the 200S Executive, for delivery to Telecom.

The new phone has a visual day/time/date display, an alarm, a built-in mike and
speaker for hands-free operation, 16  one-touch  memory buttons and  up  to  99
abbreviated dialing memories. It also provides an automatic call duration timer
and  PIN lock security, plus a  choice of using either  a plug-in AC adaptor or
three AA cells to maintain the clock and memory facilities.

The  result  of an intensive design program, the  Touchfone  200S Executive  is
destined to replace the  Versatel model supplied  to Telecom since  1987. It is
also expected to generate considerable export business.
