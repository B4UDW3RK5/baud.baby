   I have a vivid memory  of driving with my  /        _/         /         / 
family. It was 1991, the year we were living  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
in  Adelaide. It would have had to have been    /        \/        \/    /   \
early in the year because it  was hot and we   /        _/         /_       _/
were still living  with my grandparents, not  /-        /        _/         /
the  little  flat. I'd say probably January,  \________/\________/\___/____/
so we would have been on summer break.

   We were in the van, it was sweltering and the van had no aircon. I remember
the  heat, hazy and dry, rippling over  everything.  We could have been on the
way back from  the beach or on the way to the beach, or maybe we had just been
there recently,  because  I remember  sand in the creases of the car seat.  We
were travelling  south,  down  Tapleys  Hill  Road or  Frederick Road. The car
stereo was playing a tape of SNAP!'s World Power.

   I  was  in a bad  mood.  I don't remember the reason, to be  honest,  there
probably wasn't one.

   Sometimes when the  cold weather starts creeping into me I like to remember
that one moment almost 30 years ago, it's so clear that I can almost feel  the
heat from it.
