   I  have  a  love-hate  relationship  with  /        _/         /         / 
FIGlet  fonts,   on   one   hand  they're  a  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
convenient way to make a text file header or    /        \/        \/    /   \
banner look pretty  neat  but  on the  other   /        _/         /_       _/
they always look like they were generated by  /-        /        _/         /
FIGlet, the same  as everyone else's FIGlet-  \________/\________/\___/____/
generated banners and it feels kinda lazy. I
had used  a FIGlet banner on  my gopher space and in  the masthead for FAX SEX
for a while  but even then I fiddled with and  move  things around to  try and
make it look like I at least put in a little bit of effort.

   Anyway that was quite a while ago and my layout has changed significantly a
couple  times since then,  the  first change was  pretty clumsy  but  at least
original work and,  you know, you get a  little  bit better  each time so  the
second change was  a bit better and then I  think the third  big overhaul  was
when I migrated from the SDF space to here on the baby.

   I'm  pretty  happy with the style I have  going on here,  I put real effort
into getting  it  just how I liked it, though I did  hold off  on switching to
using unicode characters for a while. I never should have. "In for a penny, in
for a pound," after all.

   Anyway,  getting to my  point;  when I  was working  on the  layout  I  put
together a  font  for it, which  I jokingly referred  to as  "BABYFACE" and it
turns out FIGlet fonts are almost  criminally easy to  make so, because I love
ya, I  turned  BABYFACE into a flf. No  digits, no punctuation and the capital
letters are pre-fancied whereas on baud.baby I fancy letters on a whim.

   I  threw it in files/  and have submitted  it to some of the online  FIGlet
font tools so knock yourself out. You're the cat now dogg. I've already had  a
couple imitators in the gophersphere but they never last, maybe this will make
things a little easier for future cat wannabes.
