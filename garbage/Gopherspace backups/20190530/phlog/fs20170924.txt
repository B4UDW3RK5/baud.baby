   2017-09-11 (Day 0)

   I had daydreams about writing this first post: "All my problems are solved,
this is completely life changing, thirteen seconds after  my first  dose I was
completely cured of all mental health issues,  I'm operating at 1,209%  normal
capacity and I've been promoted and now make seven figures."

   But wouldn't  you know it the stuff still hasn't arrived! That's ok though,
still on track, just need to wait a couple days and start the new routine from
Wednesday.

   Somehow I managed to live through the weekend sober with  only a few mental
hiccups so I consider  that a win. Everything  else is pretty  stable, nothing
much to report.


   2017-09-12 (Day 1)

   Okeedokee, everything is in hand and I start tomorrow.  Warned my boss that
they're "adjusting my  medication" just in case anything  goes weird hahaha. I
did the chemical  test  but  instead of turning red  or purple  it  kinda went
pinkish? I think I just used too small a  piece, the instructions said to  use
half a tab but I used half one of my doses, so like 1/10th a tab.

   I think I hecked up with getting 100ug tabs and trying to cut them  up into
five doses,  these things are  small. If the  experiment  works, going forward
I've found another reliable dealer who sells 60ug tabs so I'd only have to cut
them into three doses  which in hindsight also makes a lot more sense in terms
of ensuring the doses are even.

   I  had  a  pretty  good  mental health  day  yesterday,  even  without  the
microdosing,  just being opiate free is improving my life already I think. Who
would have thought? Hahaha. That said, I did buy  a pack of pills yesterday. I
guess I just wanted to know I'm ready to roll back if I break down, I suppose?

   Today is already shaping up to be  not as  rad, my headache is back and I'm
grumpy.


   2017-09-13 (Day 2)

   Took the  first dose  about half an  hour ago, R  U  READY? I feel a little
spacy  but not really  much  different hahaha.  Let's  see  how my  day  goes.
Headache is still there somewhere in the back.

   Yesterday I  caved  and took a  codeine  pill,  headache was extra bad  and
nothing  I tried was working so I just gave in.  Apart from that I didn't have
too bad a day.

   Alrighty it's been like an  hour and  a  half now and  I feel  pretty  ok I
guess,  it's hard to describe. I'm alert  but without the  crystalline clarity
from caffeine, there's like a fuzz at the  sides and I feel scattered, jumping
around between a half dozen tasks instead of focussing on one. Who knows, this
could all just be my mood. I might have rolled in to work with a blank blotter
under my tongue and be  working  myself up looking for results where there are
none. Jumping at psychedelic shadows.

   I'm going to park this  here  and just  internalise this shit a while, I'll
recap at the end of the day.

   Ok so  ended  up pretty good, I'm  not sure what the  morning was  about, I
guess we'll find out if Friday morning is the same. Once the fog cleared I had
a really good day, I was engaged and working hard, generally in high  spirits.
I think  most of  my  initial  frustration is that  I  was expecting something
dramatic but it's much more subtle, it's like your day is just a little better
than  usual. Meetings go well, you  feel patient and cheerful and that in turn
makes people patient and cheerful with you.

   Here's the  prickly part though, was it even anything? How do I know if the
dose  was even essential in that?  Was I  smiling from  a chemical reaction or
just because I had a  naughty  secret? Trying not to twist myself into a  knot
about it. "When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything
at all." Huh.

   Also, becoming pretty obvious that LSD  ain't an analgesic so a through all
this  new  clarity I  still  have that  throbbing,  stupid caffeine withdrawal
headache. I feel like I need to crack my neck but it just won't come.


   2017-09-14 (Day 3)

   Running out  of  things  to write here. Headache yesterday turned into what
was probably a mild  migraine and nothing I threw at it squashed it, and right
after my saying that I hadn't had a migraine in ages. Figures.

   The day was a  mixed bag, the  highs  were  really good  but the lows  were
really shitty. It's frustrating, it  really was  a  tangible  boost but  to be
honest, right now I'm really regretting fucking with  the balance but I'll see
this through.

   Today I woke up with the same caffeine withdrawal headache and backslid and
had a big energy drink,  I just need one fucking pain-free day  so  I  can get
some  work done, you know?  Maybe I'll see  how I feel  tomorrow  after having
caffeine today, I could alternate days maybe?

   Update:  Not sayin' I'm an addict but after the energy drink this morning I
feel like I could take on the world.


   2017-09-15 (Day 4)

   Today; no headache at all, I've been taking magnesium to help with them  at
a doctor-friend's advice so hopefully they don't come  back. It's also a  dose
day and, let me tell you. TODAY I can feel it. Holy shit. I'm in a nice bright
corner of the office, on the top floor. Only one meeting and lots to do, today
should be a good day.

   It kinda comes on  like a drunk but in  reverse, I get  spacy and fuzzy but
then the fog clears and it just leaves me cheerful and confident.

   One more week and I'll publish what I've got and make a decision on whether
to continue. Right now I'm behind it, if  I can find a balance  of the LSD and
smaller amounts of  caffeine  I think it'll be a  brand new age of Cat getting
shit done.

   Update: I probably should have time stamped these or something but too late
now. Fog ain't lifting and I'm not getting as  much work done as I need to but
I feel  really good. Life  is  alright. Thanks for checking in, friends. Had a
team meeting and  it was interesting,  I can still feel anxiety pushing in  at
the corners but it's early days.
