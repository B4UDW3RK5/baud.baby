   A  jawbreaker, or  a gobstopper is a type  /        _/         /         / 
of  hard candy,  usually  they're  colorful,  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
round and usually pretty large.                 /        \/        \/    /   \

   Jawbreakers are made through a process of  /-        /        _/         /
layering, they  roll around in a flavor or a  \________/\________/\___/____/
color  for a while  until they absorb a thin
coating of it and then they move on to the next.

   They continue to accumulate fragile  layers of flavor and color until there
is an  illusion of them being something of substance,  something  interesting,
but that illusion quickly fades.  The colors  muddy, the flavors only  loosely
approximate  what they claim to be, they have no  nutritional value and at the
end of it all they're hollow, physically empty inside.

   Life is short  and valuable, don't  spend it  with things like jawbreakers.
Don't let them waste your time, don't lend them your flavor or let them  steal
your color.
