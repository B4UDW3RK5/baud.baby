   There's  this  sensation  when  you  take  /        _/         /         / 
codeine and it starts to settle in, although  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
maybe it's just me, I can't speak for anyone    /        \/        \/    /   \
else. It's  like a  slow-motion  shiver that   /        _/         /_       _/
starts  between  your  shoulder  blades  and  /-        /        _/         /
curls along your arms to your fingertips. It  \________/\________/\___/____/
rolls  down  your  back,  bubbles  in   your
stomach,  fills your  hips and then runs down your  legs until your  feet feel
miles away.

   It's tender and gentle and beautiful and I've missed it so much.

   I finally  caved and  bought some  pills from  the creepy  corners  of  the
Internet, so I'm back on my bullshit  and I'm not even ashamed. I held out for
probably a good five  months without but my  mental  health has been in such a
state  at the  moment that  I  feel like  denying  myself  simple,  relatively
harmless pleasures is just compounding depression and anxiety with no purpose.

   Yes you can argue that it's not good  for your  body, but my body is strong
and my head and heart are not so if I don't start picking my battles then I am
absolutely going to lose this fight.
