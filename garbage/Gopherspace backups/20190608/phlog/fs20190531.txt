not save you.                                 \________/\________/\___/____/

   At least, not without sacrifice and discipline.

   The Web  didn't start out  in this state, it evolved that way. It's natural
selection. The  more people consumed garbage, the  more money  garbage vendors
made so the more incentive there was to produce it, and the bigger the garbage
vendors got the more smaller people wanted a piece of the pie and it's wanting
a piece of that that drives content generation.   

   And in line with that, it's getting a piece that  drives content discovery.
I'm  sure there's a wealth of people on the Web creating content for content's
sake being squeezed  out of discussion and search results by multimedia giants
with fat wallets.

   These are the first two things you will need to sacrifice.

   Firstly,  the  Web showers  us with  content. Blogs, vlogs, podcasts,  dank
memes. If you move to Gopher you are going to have to adjust to a  drastically
slower  pace, maybe  two or  three articles a day, and significantly different
content. Gopher  content is fairly similar to  the  early blogosphere in  that
tends to be far more  personal or much narrower in scope. I can't think of any
phlogs out there that  cover the tech news or gaming or anything like  that in
any broad way.

   And  secondly discoverability in Gopher space is quite  limited, Bitreich's
Lawn does well and  FloodGap's new servers is  a  good list but they're  about
your only options, there's no central place for people  to spruik your content
like you  would see on Facebook  or any of  the hip blogs on the  surface Web.
Aside from the two examples cited above you're pretty  much limited to word of
mouth.

   It's not all doom and gloom though, the flip side of both those points both
work in  Gopher's favor,  The low-volume of  Gopher content makes it not  only
easy to keep up  with the latest happenings, it also invites contemplation and
conversation  because you're just  just barreling on to  the  next listicle or
salacious drama, and in  turn  that conversation drives  discoverability in  a
very human way, instead  of machine-generated, SEO-boosting  blog posts you're
finding things because people found them interesting enough  to  take the time
to write about them.

   The last sacrifice I  want to talk about is the dopamine rush.  While there
is social  media  in  Gopher  space, it's  a far  smaller  community and moves
drastically slower than what most  people are used to on the Web and if you're
addicted  to  that dopamine-feedback  loop you  get from that environment then
you're in for  a bad time. In  my opinion this  is the number one  reason  for
people abandoning Gopher in the modern day. For whatever reason they rage quit
the Web only to realize that down here there's nothing to feed that addiction.
Content moves slow,  there's no  upvotes, likes  or  comments section and  any
conflict is resolved through civil discussion, so they nope out and go back to
their poisonous ad-cloud.

   In  my barely-educated opinion,  as  people act out  in  more violent, more
reckless  and  more  dramatic  ways to  get  the  attention that  feeds  their
addiction,  dopamine addiction is a crisis  waiting to happen. Social media is
as toxic to  the psyche as cigarettes are to the body and one day society will
look back on it with the same "how was that  ok?" puzzlement as we would today
at the sight of children casually smoking in an old photograph.

   Ok, now I'm just ranting haha. Anyway, to conclude; throw yourself headlong
into Gopher  space and revel in it but don't expect it to be a magic bullet to
save  you from the state of the  Web,  it's  you that'll need to break habits,
break cycles, break addictions or who knows what combination  of the three and
save yourself.

   That said: it can be done! Come join us underground.
