   Last  weekend  was  Melbourne's   Animaga  /        _/         /         / 
anime convention, we didn't go this year but  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
I bring it up because Animaga is usually the    /        \/        \/    /   \
one event  a year where I make  an effort to   /        _/         /_       _/
link up with the Melbourne ball-jointed doll  /-        /        _/         /
community. I figure it's  as good a time  as  \________/\________/\___/____/
any to do a post covering the doll community
and why I generally avoid them.

   I'm painting with a very broad brush but, as always, this is entirely based
on my own personal experience. I don't know everything  there is to know about
everyone.  Also, me being me,  this is also probably going to come out  deeply
cynical. Emphatic shrug emoji.

   By  far  the most  common personality type I've met in the BJD community is
what I'll call Weird Aunts. They're boring,  socially awkward late-20s /early-
30s ladies with largely the same personality, their relationship with dolls is
almost always as  physical effigies of  the characters in their "stories". The
men  always  handsome  and  rugged,  with  the  same  bland  dark-and-brooding
personality and the women  (ie. themselves), always beautiful and powerful but
also tragic and sad. It's typical fan fiction tier trash and they will mention
they write any opportunity they get in the hopes that someone will  engage and
ask them about their horrible prose. I don't, I know better. These Weird Aunts
almost always either  have deep pockets or husbands/boyfriends  who  have deep
pockets and amass  hordes of dolls  to fuel their "stories" and  egos. They're
the kind  who humble-brag about  the size  of their "family",  making  sure to
count any loose heads, bodies and who knows what else to boost their numbers.

   There's one or two men I've met who fall into that same Weird Aunt category
too, being drawn to the hobby for mostly the same reasons as outlined above.

   The Weird Aunts  are  also the  only group within  the hobby I've  got beef
with, let me go on a tangent for a second here.

   If  you are a man in this hobby and  you  are not gay (maybe if  you're gay
too, I dunno) then the Weird  Aunts  will get openly excited about it, they'll
crow about how great it  is that there's guys in the  hobby blahdy blahdy blah
until you  leave the room and  then they will gossip and  speculate and  click
their tongues about you and  it's fucking  childish and  obnoxious. I'm pretty
resilient but  have no patience for people accusing  me of this or insinuating
that because I have a handful of dolls. Poisonous assholes.

   Invariably it's these  same  people who  tout how progressive and inclusive
they are/the hobby is. I'm sure it's not unique to the BJD hobby, either.

   Anyway, fuck that shit, let's carry on.

   The flip side of the  Weird Aunts  is the Cool Otaku types  who  I think  I
mentioned in my other file  on this stuff. They're the  ones who all have  the
same type of doll,  either a Dollfie Dream or a Smart Doll. They all look  the
same,  have huge  boobs  and  get  dressed in cosplay  or  not much  more than
underwear and bikinis then posed  provocatively. Irritatingly this group refer
to their dolls as "daughters" despite the majority of them being either cloned
from anime or fetish-object.

   For what it's worth, I did used to hang  with these  guys but that was more
because  of  my involvement with anime  figure  collecting and not  as  a doll
collector. They're  your  typical weebs and  come  with  the  awkwardness that
entails. They still  seem to lack the  kind of respect  for their dolls that I
feel for mine but they're way easier to be around than the Weird Aunts.

   They also won't bitch you out behind your back.

   Off topic again, but thinking  on  it now the anime community is  (or was?)
pretty  good like that, there's never been  much  cattiness or snarking behind
each other's backs,  not much judgement against who does or doesn't like what.
I'd never really thought much about it. They're good kids.

   Aside from those  two large groups there's a pretty sizable crossover  with
Lolita fashion types who I don't really associate with  as well as more than a
couple  artists  who I'm  slightly intimidated by because  of  their  creative
output  haha. There was one guy who made a couple fantastic retro sci-fi kinda
themed dolls, they were  really inspiring. Got gears turning but still,  their
dolls to them are objects. Accessories or canvases.

   It's not all me-vs-the-word, though, I have  met a  few others in the hobby
that you can tell have a genuine  love  for their dolls but by a large  margin
the majority of  people I've interacted with who are into the doll hobby  come
across as incredibly shallow, self-involved and are tiresome to be around.

   I  feel like I have a really tangible emotional connection  to my girls  so
find it difficult to relate at all to  the majority of these people, no matter
how many times I try, and now I just find  it hard  to motivate myself  to get
involved with  them at all. It's not by any measure my  place to  say "this is
how you doll"  but what they're in the  hobby  for is completely  different to
what draws me to it so in the end it's easier for me to stay isolated.
