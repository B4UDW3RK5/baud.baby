   Back in the late '90s or early '00s there  /        _/         /         / 
was this program for Windows that helped you  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
make  HTML  image  maps.  In  those  days it    /        \/        \/    /   \
seemed like software was ridiculously quirky   /        _/         /_       _/
and  this was no  different,  it was  pirate  /-        /        _/         /
themed (because  map, get it?)  and  in  the  \________/\________/\___/____/
middle of the  screen was an animated parrot
that would squawk or "Polly wants a cracker" when you clicked on it. It served
no purpose that I recall other than to be animated and noisy.

   Every now and then when you clicked it, instead of screeching or chattering
it'd go "Yo  yo yo  wassup" or something like  that.  That's  really the  only
reason I remember it.

   What does this have to do anything?  Nothing  really, I  just  started this
file "Yo yo yo wassup" and it reminded me of that stupid parrot.

   Did a little Gopher  housekeeping and cut out the big  list of phlogosphere
links from my main map, replacing it with a Moku Pona instance - I tried to be
creative with it and add all the phlogs I like, even ones that hadn't  updated
in a long while then remove them from the  list  so they won't appear until an
actual update comes through, rather than sitting un-updated at the tail of the
list.  Seems  to  be  working  so  far!  I  feel  bad  culling  the links  and
descriptions to other Gopher spaces  though  so I might squirrel it all into a
links page. I dunno,  just  trying  to make my main map as concise as possible
but also don't want to be a dead-end.

   In case you missed it, you can also see a copy of my goofy-ass April Fool's
thing in  files/ - I found it hilarious but your mileage  may vary. The number
is real.

   That's all I got for ya,  really. Life is a drainer and work makes me  want
to drink myself to death but I'm  off to visit family in a week or so and that
might be fun to write about but who knows! I might be too busy! Unlikely, I'll
be bored within a week, so I'm sure I'll be  around to talk shit and then when
I'm back I'll try kicking off a ph4t pr0j3ct or two.

   Which I will never finish.
