out and see Jason Scott's  keynote for their
PreserveIT! event.

   The  sketchy Subway was the sketchy Subway, we ended  up there last time we
were here, just by accident, and we  went back this time.  It's just a regular
subway but kinda sketchy  clientele. American Subway still does flat bread and
roasted  chicken,  both  had  been  removed  from  Australian  stores  because
Australia is ridiculous. They basically robbed me of my order! American Subway
also has ranch  and  pepperoncini,  we  have neither of  these things and  are
poorer for it.

   Wait, why am I still writing about Subway.

   Pacific  Galleries is amazing, it's a huge  warehouse sized antiques  mall.
Another thing we  found by accident last time we were here, we just drove past
it and  thought "that looks neat"  and neat is  right, it's  so great. Crammed
full of  some  really wild  odds and ends. We'll have to go back  because we'd
forgotten just  how big it was and didn't give  ourselves  enough  time to get
through the whole store. Did see  some really neat stuff though, unfortunately
it was mostly big neat stuff so I'll have to let it go, at least for now. They
had a pair of  beautiful vine-like  wrought iron  stair ends, salvaged  from a
demolished hotel, I'd love to repurpose them for the front stairs of  a  house
or flanking a front gate.  So perfect. Everything was really well priced  too,
they  had a pair of white  wingback  chairs in beautiful  condition  and  were
asking $1,300  each for them -  in  Australia you'd be looking  at $3,000  per
chair at least for something like that.

   Like I mentioned above,  we only had an hour to  spend there so had to bail
half way  through  the mall. If we  get  the chance  to go back  I  might make
another entry on our subsequent visit.

   We split from the antique mall and got to the LCM+L a little later than I'd
hoped because we went a  round-about way so only had about  40 minutes  in the
Vintage Collection  upstairs before  they closed  it up so we scooted up there
for a look around and it's looking so good, wow. I've been to the museum every
time I've come  to the States and it  just gets better and better.  I love the
new open workshop  area with the piles of bits and pieces, I just wanted to go
combing through it all!

   There  seems  to be less stuff  upstairs now but they've laid it out so  it
feels like there's more, it's really nice.

   Downstairs though, that was  a real treat. Last time we were  here was July
2016 and the whole downstairs area was still boarded up and under construction
so  this  is my first time seeing it and maaaan  I  loved it.  It's got a real
focus on  education and interactivity, a  bunch of stuff on robotics and  some
VR, it was super cool and I really want to drag my nephew here. I had a lot of
fun dorking around with  the telepresence robot but what really stole the show
for me is their Totally 80s Rewind exhibit. It was so perfectly executed.

   The exhibit is broken down into three rooms; a school computer lab equipped
with  Apple  IIe  computers, an arcade  and  a  basement  hangout, essentially
following  the path of  an average 80s teenager on an  average 80s  day.  They
nailed all three rooms and the attention to detail is amazing.

   The classroom  has an old school overhead projector, with a lesson in BASIC
programming  up, and of course  every machine was working so you could  do the
lesson or  just  fiddle. To  one side  was  a  bunch  of  lockers with  theme-
appropriate junk, including a Cyndi Lauper tape obviously.

   The  arcade  had  a token  vending machine  rather than  just  putting  the
machines on  free play which I thought was a really neat, authentic touch. All
the games worked and were originals or replicas, no generic MAME cabs. It also
had a working payphone, attached to the SDF VoIP system. I took a call from my
sister in Australia on it!

   The basement  room was even  better.  Ancient sofa,  CRT TV, Atari  and NES
(Although  weirdly the  top-loader, the  one  piece that  really  felt  out of
place),  desk phone (some  kind of  Model 2500 I think, also working thanks to
the SDF VoIP) and a  TRS-80.  It was really  great, if you recall way  back in
July last year I posted a  file[1] about a place called Forgotten Worlds,  the
basement room reminded me a lot of the back room in there. It was so comfy.

   Highly recommend if you're around the area to check it out, it's open until
the end of the year, I think.

   Lastly was the keynote from Jason Scott and, if you're familiar with him it
was exactly  what you'd expect from him; the value  in  archiving  everything,
archiving in practice  and the limitations and risks in doing so. The tour  of
the Internet Archive  was really  good, I hadn't  heard  of The David W. Niven
Collection  of  Early  Jazz Legends[2] before  and  that  it  exists is really
interesting. I also didn't know much of how the Archive started so it was nice
to hear him talk on that. If you aren't familiar with him, he's the guy behind
textfiles.com and BBS: The Documentary and prolific speaker.

   There were one  or two people in the crowd I recognized  but I never worked
up the nerve to say "Hi" unfortunately,  but that's ok. The crowd was actually
smaller than what I would have expected, especially for a free event with food
and drinks. Father-in-law says it's probably because  it was  a Thursday night
and  that is pretty interesting  to  me, if true.  Melbourne's  weekend starts
Thursday night, even for computer nerds. A similar event there would have been
a full house, although likely there'd be a high ratio of hipster looky-loos.

   After  the keynote finished I bailed Jason Scott up to introduce myself but
ended up fangirling a  bit about what  an inspiration he is, etc, and told him
about the  Otarchive  project.  I immediately regretted that because I haven't
scanned  in anything new  in well  over a year  so,  but at least  I feel  re-
energised to tackle it.

   We'll see if I still feel that way when I get back home, I suppose.
