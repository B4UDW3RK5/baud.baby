already, wow. Work is just  sucking  my will  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
to live  and between shit being broken there    /        \/        \/    /   \

I'm just playing whack-a-mole trying to keep  /-        /        _/         /
everything in order. Most of it is my fault,  \________/\________/\___/____/
I tinker with things at home, break them and
struggle to fix them and I don't push back at  work when I'm handed crazy shit
because I want to give it a shot and see if I can do it. "Curiosity killed the
cat," I suppose the old saying goes!

   I guess six or so posts in I should do something of an introduction.

   Cat isn't  my real  name but  it's what everyone calls me. It doesn't  mean
anything. It's not my fursona and I'm not some kind of cat-otherkin, it's just
a nickname that stuck, although sometimes I do play it up.

   I live on the south-west coast  of Australia  with my fiance who's from the
PNW. I was born here and have lived here all my life but she's immigrated over
so we  could  be  together, although I'm sure we'll be relocating back to  the
United States before too long. We met on Twitter of all places.

   IRL  I'm a Salesforce admin  in the finance sector. I love Salesforce, it's
fun and frustrating and the culture is really great  but I  don't really enjoy
what I do.  Where I work  is irritatingly flaky  about  this stuff, they don't
have  any   appetite  for  innovation  in  our  CRM  space  and  our  team  is
embarrassingly aligned to sales targets rather than technology deliverables. I
guess someone saw  the "sales" in Salesforce and stopped reading. I'm honestly
surprised  no  one's  bought  the IT  guys squeegees  yet, since  they support
"Windows".

   Aside from that  like to  do  Old  Nerd Shit(tm)  which, given that  you're
reading this  on a  Gopher server and  my previous post on  the Otarchive,  is
probably pretty obvious.

   That's  all I  got for ya. Posting for  posting's  sake to be  honest. Stay
tuned for more riveting content.
