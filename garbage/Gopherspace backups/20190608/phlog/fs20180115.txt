   Just quickly, a small addition to the "my  /        _/         /         / 
favorite  software"   chatter;  The   Gopher  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
Browser[1].  It doesn't  seem  to  get  much    /        \/        \/    /   \
traction  in the  gopher  community,  likely   /        _/         /_       _/
because  it's  for  Windows and it's closed-  /-        /        _/         /
source, but without a doubt it really is the  \________/\________/\___/____/
comfiest GUI gopher client  I've  ever used.
Renders everything perfectly and lets you  configure the colors/fonts, handles
images and PDFs, colors visited links and keeps bookmarks and everything you'd
want  in  a browser. It's  a gem and I really miss it since  jumping back to a
macOS machine, I have high hopes  for prologic's gopherclient[2] but it has  a
long  way to go  so for the time being  The Gopher Browser is still  the  gold
standard for GUI gopher clients in my opinion.
