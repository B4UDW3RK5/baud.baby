   Now I know I'm an old man and conventions  \________/\________/\___/____/
are a young person's game  but I try  to see
them through because usually they make me feel nostalgic of the old days, this
one though I was really feeling my age. It just felt really flat, the  content
was pretty bland and the crowd  seemed really low-energy, like even  the  kids
letting their freak flag fly seemed subdued.

   Let me break it down.

   Saturday we rolled in  and took a minute to check out the itasha parked out
front of the venue, they're always a highlight, then collected our tickets and
got  inside, the  hall  was  cold as heck which  was  a  bummer  but  not  the
convention's fault, the venue is ancient. The entrance leads straight into the
vendors area  so we check that out and it's mostly the same crowd as any other
Australian  anime  convention.  After  that we  checked  out the schedule  for
something to do and ended up sitting in on a Harajuku fashion  show which  was
just three  girls in lolita  outifts,  not much of a show but good on them for
getting on stage I suppose. They were pretty cute. After that we just wandered
around  for  ages,  the panels were  so uninteresting  and the guests  weren't
anyone we were interested in. We orbited the doll exhibit but  it  wasn't much
to speak of.  I'm glad they try  but it just seems so low effort, they  try to
create  these dioramas but  there's  no  signage  or info  or  anything on why
they're there, just walking past you couldn't tell  they were even supposed to
be there, it just looks like  some  doll people found  a dark  corner  for  an
impromptu meet up. That said though, I did promise last year that I'd offer to
help out this year and I didn't so I shouldn't point fingers.

   I  really  need  to take  some time  to  figure out how  I feel  about  the
Melbourne doll crowd.  I want  to participate  again but I just don't have the
patience for people and it seems like my shyness and social anxiety is off the
charts lately.

   After watching one of the artist guests do a Q&A and live drawing panel for
a  little  while we checked  out the  anime  clubs  panel  but they  were only
representatives from university clubs, not really relevant to a fossil like me
hahaha. I think  we got  something  to eat  after  that  then came back  for a
cosplay  parade and  part  of  one  of the  cosplay  competitions. Cosplay  at
Australian cons these days  feels like it's undergoing an shift, it seems like
old fashioned  DIY, get up  on stage and do  a  few  poses  cosplay is getting
squeezed  out by bought-your-costume-online-but- learned-a-dance-routine  Love
Live  and similar cosplay.  I've always maintained skits should  be eliminated
from  cosplay  competitions altogether but  at least a  dance  routine is less
cringey than some pale nerds in  horrible wigs mouthing dubbed lines  from the
show.

   After  the  cosplay we  sat in on the  Ball-jointed doll  panel and  it was
pretty good this year, a lot more structured overview and less ad-hoc Q&A, the
kind of panel I like.  The guy that ran it this year was new and seems to know
his shit.

   After that we split to get some dinner and ate way too much BBQ chicken.

   We ended up getting in late  on Sunday too but there  wasn't much we wanted
to see, the  timetable for  the two days were pretty similar unfortunately but
it is  what it is. I had  Ilsa with me  this time so we drifted  past the doll
people first thing  but, I dunno, I wasn't really feeling  like I  could  push
through shyness/social anxiety, so I just said hi to the few people I knew and
made excuses to keep floating around the hall.

   Ilsa got a few comments, including one lady whipping her head around as  we
walked past, crowing about how cute she is. Don't need to tell me, lady! Haha.

   It occurs  to me  I haven't  really talked about  my doll  family, I should
write a post about that, or at least a who's-who.

   We hit  up the maid cafe next and  wow,  let me tell you, even if  I wasn't
feeling anxious this would have been torture. We've gone every year, last year
was really good because  Hitomi from @home Cafe was  there coaching the  maids
but this year it wasn't  so great.  Our maid was pretty awkward and that  just
amplified my awkwardness, it was so bad. I honestly thought it was just me but
another maid  came  over  to  help  out  and she  was totally  disarming, just
friendly  and casual. I dunno!  Anyway, it culminated in our maid  WATCHING US
EAT and that was it, I wanted to kill myself.

   After  that ordeal we caught the lolita fashion competition which was nice,
everyone really did great, not many slouches  in the lolita scene because they
eat each other alive hahaha.

   We took another  lap of the floor and caught a guest artist panel, ran into
someone who  recognised us from the anime club and then checked out the second
BJD panel,  more on doll care and stuff. It wasn't as  good as the first panel
but good on  them for  doing it. We  went back past the BJD area to say thanks
for  the  panel and  then  went to  the  main  stage for  the  Animaga cosplay
competition  and the closing ceremony. They  were fun,  the guy presenting was
pretty chill and did a good job of it.

   And that was that! We left and went to our favorite Japanese restaurant,  a
tradition  for us, except it  would be  our  last  meal there  since they were
closing the next day. I was genuinely sad about it.

   It's also likely my last casual convention too,  for reasons I'll go  in my
next post in like 200 years.
