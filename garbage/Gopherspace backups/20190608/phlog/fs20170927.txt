Adelaide's  AVCon anime conventions[1]. It's  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
a real  trip to think  that  he  and I would    /        \/        \/    /   \

ago.  Heck,  with the quiz  nights  we would  /-        /        _/         /
have been in the  same room laughing  at the  \________/\________/\___/____/
same dumb nonsense, it's a small world.

   His sentiments pretty closely  echo  mine;  a clumsy, sketchy  but fun  and
casual con gets bloated and muddied and less fun. Old fans get squeezed out to
make way  for the new, let's say "less dedicated" fans.  It  really is a place
that conventions  don't come  back from, especially  once stuff starts  cross-
pollenating.  Animaga  is specifically  anime/manga/games but you  still  have
people cosplaying as Doctor Who, ponies, Homestuck and all that shit.

   It kinda feels dumb to be mad at it but at the same time, you know, get off
my lawn.

   Off  the back of his  post, I was considering  writing up my AVCon memories
too but I think I might have something a little  different  instead, watch out
for that.
