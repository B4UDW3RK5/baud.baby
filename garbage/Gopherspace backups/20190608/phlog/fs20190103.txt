   Dani works in  retail so the weeks before
and following  Christmas are some of her busiest  times, before Christmas that
was no  big deal because I was at  work too but my office shuts  down  between
Christmas and new year so after  Christmas I was left home  alone with no real
motivation to do much. I filled a bit  of the time  by streaming a whole bunch
on Tildeverse Radio, I had no real plan for what I was going to do but for the
most part I ended up delving into a bunch of mixtapes I never finished.

   I outlined  the tapes a couple  times  on  the stream but  the short,  text
version;  before I was involved with aNONradio I was half-making mixtapes  for
the fun of it, mostly on a specific genre or with a specific theme or concept.
Some of these ended  up transitioning into  LOW WIRE playlists  and  some were
broken down into  parts for Soft Ash but most of them were just left abandoned
and unfinished.

   I was looking  for something to play on Tilde Radio and dug into one of the
tape tracklists as  an easy jumping-off  point but instead it set me off on  a
whole journey. It's  split out over a few  archives and over a few days so let
me give you a  quick guide, in case you'd  like to listen! The headings should
match filenames in the  list on https://archive.tilderadio.org/cat/  - if they
don't, let me know and I'll fix this file.

   Apologies for the blips and bloops, the silence and the sloppy streaming in
places, I was goofing with my setup and settings during these and trying to do
a few new  things on the fly and drinking all the while! It's all  part of the
fun, really.

   Also be mindful of your ears at the start and end because the  automatic DJ
really comes booming in on a few of the files.

      This is loosely related, though I wasn't really streaming with a plan
   to dig  into the mixtapes at this point and wasn't  all that chatty. The
   music I  play is mostly  from  what was  the Secret  Bunny Base: Kitchen
   mixtape, which is a lot of soul/Motown sound and similar.

      This starts half  way through a song because my internet  dropped out
   but all you missed was  me  mumbling while I got  my  stuff  set  up, my
   internet continues to be wiggy for a little while and you get  to listen
   to me troubleshoot! Like the previous  archive this was me just  digging
   into the mixtapes for a starting point, I play a lot of 90s/gangster rap
   at the start and about half an hour in I'm joined by Dylan Wallclock for
   a little  while  (clumsily,  apologies for the  mess while  we set it up
   haha).

      I'm  talking with my mouth full for a little bit at the start of this
   one, I make  no  apologies haha. Grape salad. Delicious. Having Dylan on
   the stream with me reminded of the two playlists we were tossing up when
   doing he was going to help me with  for LOW WIRE over Christmas which in
   turn kicked  off the dive  into the  mixtape playlists.  Really  you can
   thank Dylan for this whole  thing! At  the  start of this stream  I talk
   about the mixtapes themselves, how they relate  to LOW WIRE,  etc. We go
   through a mixtape concept of a group of teenage friends, cruising to the
   beach in California in the summer of 1991. The music is Lots of old hard
   rock and  rock  ballads.  Towards  the  end I  start  going  through and
   outlining some of the other tape playlists I had in my list.

      In this file I take  you through the "Not the '80s" playlist, a bunch
   of more  recent songs that have an '80s vibe. This one was  a lot of fun
   to revisit. I ramble on about the Venture Bros. cartoon and the Kentucky
   Route Zero video game and a bunch of other  stuff  and we listen to some
   really  great music.  I misspoke at one  point  about the dates  for Sid
   Luscious; I said  2011/2012,  I meant 2001/2002 but was still wrong, the
   album was released  2005  haha.  Also,  at  about 45  minutes in Spotify
   flakes out for me for a few seconds.

      We  go  through  the  "Not  the  '80s"  playlist  until  about  1:18,
   afterwards I play another  track from one of the artists that was on the
   mixtape and then I go right into some of the tracks that would have been
   from  an "'80s Album  Tracks"  mixtape.  Unfortunately the archive kinda
   eats the last few seconds.

      I dunno  why the first bit of this  didn't archive but  it was mostly
   just me just fiddling with my Audio Hijack settings, deciding what I was
   going to play and talking about the washing machine tripping the circuit
   breaker  in  the  apartment.  This  is  mostly from  the  chip-pop  tape
   tracklist and try  to  find  a  few more  tracks to fill it out but lose
   interest  and play  some Japanese idol stuff instead to  round  out  the
   hour. This hour was not so interesting, I don't provide much context for
   what you're listening to but the music is good!

      Starts  halfway through a song but it was just something  I threw  on
   while I  got myself  organized. My mic volume is  a bit low on this one,
   not sure why, probably from when I was fiddling with the settings in the
   previous stream. In this file I talk about what we  were going to do for
   LOW  WIRE  on the  week I  was away and go through most  of  the Barcade
   mixtape, which was the other playlist we had earmarked for Dylan to use.
   Lots of funky party tracks. I also talk about making a Pi-hole, take  an
   adventure into  adding more inputs to  Audio Hijack and  other rambling.
   Except for the start, I don't actually talk  much about the mixtapes  in
   this one at all haha.


   tilderadio-2018-12-31T03:14:03.mp3                               1:43:46

      Internet  wigs  out a  bit at the start but we  continue through  the
   glitchy hip hop and spoken word mixtapes and I rattle on at length about
   the artists in the playlists. I try to play a CD but no dice, I think it
   would have worked but I couldn't  find the CD and still haven't found it
   so I dunno  what's up with  that. At  about 55 minutes in I accidentally
   move  a  block and  heck up my streaming setup so there's a bit of chaos
   for about ten minutes,  but also some insight  into the way I have Audio
   Hijack set up.

      Starts  off  with  the  few  tracks  from  what  would  have  been  a
   hackers/hacking kinda cyberpunk themed tape but then drifts into just me
   playing  and  talking  about  Jared  Hendrickson,  Chemlab  and  related
   artists,  and then  some loosely related UK  electro industrial stuff. I
   misspoke at one point and said Charles Levi was in KMFDM but  I meant My
   Life With the Thrill Kill Kult haha. I also discover that there might be
   some kind  of Six  Degrees  (I  accidentally say "seven") of Kevin Bacon
   situation with bands I like and Jared Hendrickson.

      Starts back on  track  with revisiting  the mixtapes, looking  at the
   tracklist of an indie  rock tape, but then goes quickly off-track when I
   start  talking  about  lost  or forgotten  music,  mp3.com,  responsible
   hipsters and why you should share what you're listening  to  and promote
   the heck out of everyone.


   A  huge thank you to anyone who listened to while I was doing  them live or
has listened to the archives.  Thank  you  to everyone who still tunes in  for
Soft Ash and  sincere thank  you to the Tildeverse Radio guys for  setting the
service up and to the other DJs for doing what they do.
