Another one bites the dust as I kinda struggle  with fiding my groove for Soft
Ash. Will carry on but, I dunno, I need to find something to settle my head on
this show because at the moment it feels like a bit of a struggle to do it.

Thank  you to  everone  who  tuned in live or  anyone  listening  through  the
archive! I really appreciate it.
