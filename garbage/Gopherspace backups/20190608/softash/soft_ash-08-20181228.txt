Was super unprepared  for this  one so it's all last minute  and kinda loosey-
goosey. Some pretty vanilla goth rock.

I  also did a whole bunch of ad-hoc streams during the week which you can find
in the archives  on  tilderadio.org, I  played and  talked about  all kinds of
stuff and they were vastly more interesting than Soft Ash hahaha.
