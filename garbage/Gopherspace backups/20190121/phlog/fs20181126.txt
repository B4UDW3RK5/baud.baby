   Firstly,  I  started   a  second  regular  /-        /        _/         /
streaming radio gig,  like,  three weeks ago  \________/\________/\___/____/
hahaha. It is called Soft Ash and unlike LOW
WIRE, where I play whatever I feel like, I'm taking  a shot at sticking  to  a
few narrower  genres, specifically gloomy  stuff like goth  rock, darkwave and
post-punk.  I'm sure  I'll play some  loosely related stuff down the track but
it's proving interesting  to approach  a  show that way. You think you  know a
genre pretty well but when you really sit down  and think  about it, sometimes
you just listen to  a small part of it on  repeat.  I'm  having a lot  of  fun
though, hope you'll  tune  in!  I do  it  every Friday at  21:00  UTC  on  the
Tildeverse Radio stream, check out tilderadio.org for more info.

   LOW WIRE trucks  along  on aNONradio's stream, getting  a bit bolder  about
what kind of stuff I play on there. In a way the drama earlier  was a blessing
in that it reset my mindset of the whole thing. I kinda tiptoed around playing
anything too  far out of left field because I had this idea  that LOW WIRE was
bigger than it  was but now I've been reminded  that, like all my online shit,
it  is  low-visibility,  disposable and  I should use it  how I  want, not how
people expect it should  be used. It  made it  more  fun as soon as I  stopped
giving a fuck about levelling up listener counts and fussing over who did/said
or didn't do/say whatever. Now I just play music and talk shit for an hour! As
it should be.

   Overall  my streaming  radio game is  getting stronger,  I'm  getting  more
confident chatting on  and  better at picking tracks, overall  timing, etc. It
makes  me  happy.  I  do need  to work on my  setup though  because wow is  it
starting to hurt my neck hunching over that desk haha.

   What else? Shit I knew I should have written stuff down.

   Trying to get my head around some  project management stuff, I have so much
shit  on the go  that none of it gets done, I just  look at the pile and  lose
interest because I have no idea where to start.

   Very slowly working on a thing I can't talk about which is frustrating.

   Need to work on doll things before I lose the motivation.

   The "baby" for baud.baby fizzled out because it's too hard to  find a cheap
blinking doll so maybe  I'll try doing something  else  for it. I saw a Gopher
server a month or two ago (I forget who it belonged to sorry) that was running
on a 486, maybe something along those lines.

   A  bunch  of  other stuff  I  don't have time  or  space  for in  our  tiny
apartment. Bleh.

   Not to  mention wanting to find the time  to help out  or get involved with
friends' projects too.

   And at  the  same time  getting  really  impatient with  social  media, the
fediverse just seems to have its obnoxiousness level turned up lately. I'm not
even  involved,  it's just a  bunch  of  ridiculous  people firing ignorant or
narcissistic shit over my bow endlessly.

   And work is work, as greedy towards its staff  as legally possible. I don't
think I'll last another year here.

   And at the same time still frustratingly trying to get  back  on track with
the diet and also out of drugs again. Emphatic shrug.

   Fuck it, I bummed myself out.

   This file sucks.

   Depression is a son of a bitch.
