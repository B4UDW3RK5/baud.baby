but I want to talk  about this  past weekend  \________/\________/\___/____/
and Madman Anime Festival, 2017.

   Madman  Entertainment  is  an  Australian  company  that  got  their  start
distributing English language  anime from Manga Entertainment UK and ADV Films
in the  mid-90s,  they've since grown into  a pop-media titan  and  last year,
coinciding with  their 20th anniversary  they started their  own convention in
Melbourne;  Madman Anime Expo (MadFest for  short).  The con went so well they
did three this year, in Perth, Brisbane and Melbourne.

   Now, y'all read about the disconnect after Animaga[1], my weird link to the
anime convention  circuit  was  severed  so  I shouldn't  have been at another
convention  unless  there was a really  good reason for me to be  there and in
this case that reason was Ladybeard.

   For the uninitiated, Ladybeard is an Australian-born entertainer in  Japan,
he sings, dances  and wrestles all  in  cute outfits and cosplay. He was in an
idol  group  called  Ladybaby  and  later  formed a  group  with another  body
builder/wrestler idol called Deadlift Lolita. We've been fans for  a while  so
when we heard  he  was going to be at  the convention we had to go  and it was
absolutely worth it.

   Saturday  started  off  kind of bumpy, we needed something for him to sign,
the convention booklet  would have been fine but merch would  have been better
so we asked some staff  and they had no idea.  We got in line for the meet and
greet  and then found out they DID have merch. Good. But  cash  only. Bad, and
that one's really on  me, I should have known better than to wander into a con
without cash. I ducked out of line to get some old  fashioned money and when I
came back I didn't want to cut back in because I don't want to be a shit, it's
not anyone's fault I didn't come prepared, so I joined the end of the line. He
arrived late because  of a drama with his flight but  the  line plodded along,
everything ok until one of  the staff started kicking people  out of the  line
saying he can "guarantee you won't get in this session".

   I  was heartbroken, the only  reason I'd come to  the con was for Ladybeard
and  in trying to do the  right thing I'd fucked myself. I was sour and stayed
in the line anyway because fuck it, as long as  he was still going I was still
queuing. They passed  back a  book  to write a message to  Ladybeard and I was
kind of snotty in it which I regret but I was angry and upset and embarrassed.

   I stuck  it out though and did manage to get in the tail end  of that first
session.  I got a copy of the Deadlift Lolita Muscle Cocktail single and got a
hug and a polaroid, it was great, he's  the sweetest most disarming guy you'll
ever meet. I love him.

   Right after that first  autograph session was  done he went straight to his
Q&A panel which was great, really interesting to  hear how he got  started and
what  a difficult  path  he'd  chosen and the  fan  questions  were all really
interesting.

   Then after the Q&A he was right back to the second autograph session and so
were we,  this time to meet him  together since we were separated in the  line
the first time and to pick up something singed for my sister who is also a fan
but couldn't  attend. We  got a three  shot polaroid and more  hugs and then I
think we called it a day. Hopefully he did too hahaha, from Tokyo to Melbourne
to  an autograph session to a panel to a  second session without  a break, the
dude is a machine.

   Sunday  we had more  tickets  for photos, they  were  given out with  merch
purchases and  Dani had an  extra couple given to  her by someone in  line who
wasn't going  to  use them, but skipped  the  morning autograph session so  we
could see some other parts of the  con and because we were feeling a bit self-
conscious about taking up so much of his time.

   We attended his  concert and that  was wild, people crowding the stage  and
waving lightsticks  and this is where he really shined. The  adoration he  has
for his audience  was so  genuine. He  did  a few  songs and at one point  was
interrupted by  an Australian wrestler who had some very disparaging things to
say about anime and anime fans so they rumbled on stage and through the crowd,
it was a good time.

   We  caught one more autograph session to say  goodbye and use the remaining
photos we had or give them  away, we ended up getting two more three-shots and
Dani had one more with just the two of them, I didn't feel confident enough to
get another  one with just the two of us and was  kinda hiding behind Dani  by
this point but I'll go over that  in  a  sec. We  had more hugs, said goodbye,
Dani told him  to get  some  rest, I told him he smelled amazing and  that was
that. We wobbled off, exhausted but all smiles.

   Ladybeard aside, the con was pretty good, lots to see and do, Madman throws
a good party. Lots  of con exclusive screenings, vendors and talented artists.
The variety at the vendors felt a bit thin if you  weren't  into Love Live but
that's the landscape right now so it is what it is.

   On Saturday we didn't get up to much aside from  Ladybeard but on Sunday we
found out  there's a  wotagei group  in  Melbourne but  they're small and seem
pretty insular, just some guys that  were  already friends. I tried to talk to
them a bit but got nowhere.  They mentioned  they were a club but when I asked
they said  not really, they said they had a  YouTube channel  but when I asked
they said to just search for wotagei and there's lots of good videos. Oh well,
I  tried? Dani was a little bummed, we're really struggling to find much of an
idol  fandom in Australia  and  when  we do  find some  people  we share  idol
interests with it's either  a superficial passing fancy, insular or  just Love
Live.

   After the wotagei demonstration there was a live from a group called AGS102
and they are legit.  They're from a maid cafe  in Sydney  and they've captured
the  Japanese  maid  and idol  act  perfectly. They were  excited  to announce
they're  opening two  cafes in Melbourne. Not sure  if they're permanent or if
they're pop-ups  but  you can count on  me  to attend  and report back, sports
fans.

   Between the  morning panels  and  the  Ladybeard  concert I  had kind  of a
meltdown, my face  has  been kind of messed up  the  last week  or  so  from a
combination of allergies,  dehydration  and  eczema  and it  really flared  up
around my eyes, leaving me feeling super self-conscious. I legitimately wanted
to  go home and if it wasn't for the concert being next I probably would have,
if it was  another meet  and greet or autograph  thing I would  have  felt too
anxious to  stay. Thankfully Dani  is an angel and took me out into the sun to
burn off some of the  bad brain and the concert got me fired up enough  to not
let it beat me.

   Ok. So, the question on no one's mind; was my anchor there?

   Yes he was.  We walked right past him in the middle  of the hall, I pointed
him out to Dani and  we both got excited. Later Dani remarked "why was that so
emotional?!" hahahaha. I was glad  to  see him. We saw him again  on Sunday at
the  wotagei  demonstration and he even  was up  and participating  during the
AGS102 concert, it made me genuinely happy. Is that weird?

   Now I'm faced with a decision; my one-sided pact was that if I attend a con
in Melbourne and he's not there then I'm done, my time  is over unless there's
a really good reason  for me to attend. There was  a really good reason and he
was there so is the  orbit renewed or  am I set adrift? Does it matter that no
cons had passed between the one he skipped and this one? Is any of this really
worth thinking about?

   Answers on the back of an evite, I guess.
