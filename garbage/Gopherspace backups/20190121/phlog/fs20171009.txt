   Today was overall a good dose day, it was  /        _/         /         / 
unintrusive  and  I  was  feeling  cool  and  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
getting  shit  done,  but  I had what was my    /        \/        \/    /   \
first "is this  my mental health  or is this   /        _/         /_       _/
the drug" moment  after work this afternoon.  /-        /        _/         /
It would have been about eight hours after I  \________/\________/\___/____/
dosed so  the  drug should have been rolling
off.

   I  left work feeling  fine and  had to run  an errand before coming home so
went a  different route  which  has  a  lot more  foot traffic than  the way I
usually  go,  as  I was crossing  the bridge near  the  train station  I saw a
feather, it wasn't an especially significant  feather  it was just from a gull
or  something, but  it was flattened and  dirtied and  trampled  from all  the
people stepping on it as they walked past and in that second I went from chill
to furious in the  blink of an eye, it was surreal. It was compressed  into in
the space of two or three seconds.

   Seeing  the  state  of  the feather  and the  people stomping by  I was  so
viscerally  outraged that  these fat, heavy,  ugly, crude  animals could be so
disrespectful to something so beautiful and magical that I wanted to scream. I
wanted to draw blood.

   It literally played out like this:

   Step, step, feeling pretty good, music up loud, got stuff to do.

   Step, spy the feather.

   Step, burst into flames.

   Step, fine again.

   Step, stop, what the heck was that?

   For a nanosecond it was a little scary and put me in a weird headspace.
