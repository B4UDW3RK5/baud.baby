going to be  a  short list  of  reasons  you   /        _/         /_       _/

equivalent of empty calories? This  FAX  SEX  \________/\________/\___/____/
file, I guess!

   Firstly, shout out jebug29 for getting a Gopher server  up and  running for
his college  computer club[1], it's a fun  space and the quirky computer  club
vibe kinda weirdly makes  me nostalgic  in a way haha.  Give it  a look. Every
computer club should have a Gopher space, to be honest.

   Also I'm late to the party on cmccabe's really amazing piece on the history
and future of public access Unix systems[2] but it's well worth a read!

   And  finally,  I wanted  to highlight this post[3] zlg made on the value of
men. I had half-formed a response to it but I don't feel like  I'm  articulate
enough lately  and I think it's better  to read it and form your own  opinion.
Regardless,  I admire  him  for  publishing  it  since  it's  a topic that  is
difficult  to publicly discuss with any civility on  the  surface-Internet.  I
like to think Gopher space can handle differences of opinion without  cryptic,
passive-aggressive jabs. Most of it can, anyway.

   I do, however, absolutely agree  with  the note in his closing comment that
"both friends seem socially stunted". Hahaha.

   Lately "socially stunted" feels like it's quickly becoming the new normal.
