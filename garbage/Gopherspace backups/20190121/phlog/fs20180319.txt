arrives hand-in-hand with it.

   Not sure  what your diet entails or  what your goals are but I've been on a
VLCD (very low calorie  diet) program for  a couple months now  and  trying to
balance the this-is-for-the-best mindset and the comfort of old habits is very
difficult, throw shit like  depression into the  mix and it's  near impossible
but NOT impossible.

   The shortcomings  of diets  are  that they are generally  built on the bare
function of  the animal, neglecting  the spirit. The  mind  does not  speak  a
"nutritionally  complete"  language  and  craves   the  mental  and  spiritual
nutrition that sucking down a shake every morning can't provide.

   I wish I had some sage advice to make it  easier but all I  tell you things
you already know; stick with it, it gets  easier and the results are worth it.
The important part is a slip or a falter isn't a fail, there's no single patty
melt big  enough to undo  whatever progress  you've made so  far and the ennui
will pass, I promise.

   I dunno, if you're anything like me then when you're feeling down "It'll be
ok" is the last thing you want to hear but I hope this helps a little.
