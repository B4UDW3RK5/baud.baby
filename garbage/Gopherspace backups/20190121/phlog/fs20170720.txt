   There's  been  a  bit of  chatter  around  /        _/         /         / 
phlog feedback and comments so I thought I'd  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
throw in my $0.02, for what it's worth.         /        \/        \/    /   \
                                               /        _/         /_       _/
   Personally,  my ideal feedback  mechanism  /-        /        _/         /
would meet the following criteria:            \________/\________/\___/____/

    > It  should   be   open  and  publically   accessible   to  facilitate
      conversation, if you have anything private to say you can do so via a
      direct  email or whatever. Likewise it shouldn't be server  specific,
      you  should be able to comment or respond  to what I've written on my
      phlog whether you host with SDF or not, and likewise I should be able
      to give feedback on yours.

    > The caveat to the above is that it should be reasonably restricted to
      relevant users. I'm not saying there should be a secret  handshake to
      be  able  to  participate  but  you  should at  least have  a  Gopher
      presence,  whether you use  it or  not.  This  will  probably  happen
      organically since Gopher is niche and most info on the phlogs will be
      spread via the phlogs.

    > It shouldn't  be  real  time, like  an  IRC  channel or  COM room,  a
      participant  shouldn't  miss some sort  of  response  to  their phlog
      because they weren't lurking in the chatroom 24/7.

    > It shouldn't "crack the egg" of the Gopher experience and needs to be
      in line with how Gopher is used. It'd be jarring and exclusionary  to
      expect someone to switch  from reading a Gopher phlog in a term to  a
      flashy HTML5  website  just to  participate  in a  discussion on  its
      content.

    > It should be  self-moderated. No higher  power dictating what can and
      can't be said or policing  language, etc.  Gopher ain't 4chan and I'd
      like to think we're all pretty civil.

   Ultimately I  agree  with  slugmax's  suggestion  of  a  phlogging-specific
newsgroup, it ticks most of my boxes.
