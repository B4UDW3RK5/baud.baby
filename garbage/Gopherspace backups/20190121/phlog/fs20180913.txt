   The methodology this time is more in-line with what  I  was trying with the
nasal spray but less idiotic: I've  picked up a 1ml oral syringe and dissolved
four tabs in 40ml of water. The tabs contain about 125ug of LSD each so,  each
millilitre of liquid  should  contain  ~12.5ug, probably a little less because
the tabs don't dissolve  completely  so  there's  some of the drug trapped  in
there but whatever, close enough.

   I  figure it's a good place to start since most of my "good" dose days were
somewhere between 10  and 15ug  and I can fine tune it by pulling more or less
liquid with the syringe until I'm in a good spot. I re-started Monday at .9ml,
~11.25ug of LSD and it  went really well, though I had  some other issues that
day  that kinda  brought me  down and then again on Wednesday at .8ml  (~10ug)
just in case it was  the drug that was making me feel unwell on  Monday and it
was a pretty good  day too. I'll bump back up to maybe a whole ml tomorrow and
see where I land, I think that'll give me a good gauge on how each dose falls.

   If I continue beyond that, I'll keep you posted, as always.

   On  one hand  it's nice to  be messing with  wetware  again  and during the
planning  I  was  excited to restart  the  microdosing  but,  I dunno,  lately
everything just seems pointless haha.
