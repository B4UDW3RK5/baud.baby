   You've probably heard by now what I'm  on  /        _/         /         / 
the  outs with them so let's talk about  the  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
SDF for a bit.                                  /        \/        \/    /   \
                                               /        _/         /_       _/
   For  a  little while  the  SDF  has  been  /-        /        _/         /
pretty  broken, particularly permissions  on  \________/\________/\___/____/
the cluster (for git and perl for  example),
the SDF VoIP service not configured for new users  and not upgraded for paying
users and aNONradio  frequently dropping out, sometimes to the point of  being
completely unlistenable.

   I've been  pretty  vocal about my dissatisfaction  around the  whole  mess,
particularly  the VoIP; it's fine to  expect that if it's a free toy you might
have to be patient but if you are paying for a service and not getting it then
that's a different  story. I posted a bit on Mastodon and in  com during  VoIP
discussions about how unhappy I was with the state of things.

   In parallel with all  this, another SDF  user also voiced their frustration
with the state of the SDF and a lack of response from the sysop(s) and, though
far more civil about it  than I was being was banned, to my knowledge  without
warning, not only from their Mastodon social instance but from the SDF's shell
as well. I saw at least the Mastodon  side of this happen as I was a moderator
at the time, and still have the  email notification when they were reported by
the  @SDF account, though I've lost  access  to the  admin tools now so you'll
just  have to take my word for  this; they  were reported  by and  immediately
suspended by @SDF with the reason being only "None".

   It was so unthinkable  that  someone could be  banned from  a community for
very gently expressing something  they didn't like about  it. I was already on
the edge about SDF but that  tipped me right over and I started withdrawing; I
moved to  my  own Pleroma  instance for the fediverse, cancelled  my  MetaARPA
membership  and backed up  the config and mail  I'd accumulated in  my time on
their platform. At the time, I did stop short of nuking LOW WIRE.

   So I  think  only  a  few  days later, I  was  playing  around on  the  new
Tildeverse  Radio service  and wanted to  boost the usual "I'm live  now, come
listen if you like!" posts on my old  SDF account because  it still had better
reach than my new account and  it'd pop it  into the SDF local to catch anyone
who might be interested. While I was able to log  in fine, I couldn't view any
pages  and everything  told  me  I  did not  have  access. My  login  had been
suspended and all it's content fragged.

   To be fair, I can't see what happened and don't care  to ask so maybe I was
reported  by someone else for  some stupid shit and was suspended for that but
who knows, unfortunately  I don't have  an email from whatever report was made
against me because I'd turned all that off when I left the SDF instance.

   Knowing what had happened to the other user earlier I scrambled to check if
my shell access and everything was removed too; shell still worked, VoIP still
worked but LOW WIRE's mountpoint didn't.

   At the time I  just  shrugged and moved on, I didn't have the  patience for
any bullshit and I don't beg so instead I spoke with the Tildeverse Radio guys
and made arrangements to move LOW WIRE there if I  needed to. They were really
welcoming, even though  I was probably reeking of e-drama.  I  wasn't going to
even try and fix my aNON access because "fuck those assholes" but in the end I
did email the list, for no reason other than so no one could say I didn't try.

   In  the end I was told  it was an unrelated issue  that  occurred when they
removed my MetaArray access. I'll take  that  with a grain of salt but have no
evidence to say either way. I  did get a second-hand excuse that the new-  old
admin is  still learning  the  ropes but honestly don't really care. LOW  WIRE
trucks on for now and  still does ok for listeners despite my being the "black
sheep" of aNONradio.

   The banning  and mount  problems  solidified  what  was  already  a general
distaste  for  the SDF and that,  paired with the fact  that I'd already moved
most of my  shell  stuff to another system to work around losing screen access
left me wondering what even is the appeal of SDF anymore?

   In my mind the SDF had two  major draws; pedigree and community. I'm coming
at this purely from a shell provider angle, I can't speak to their web hosting
and MOTD stuff because I've never been interested.

   The  SDF has a long, long  history and even in its current  state of public
access NetBSD system it has been around  for a long time, far longer than just
about anything else on the  Internet. That's it's  pedigree, but recently even
that  has been eroded and when SDF's long-time admin smj stepped away, a large
part of  that pedigree  was lost. You could  argue that iczer  has been around
just as long but he hasn't, he  left for, what, decades?  With  smj  the SDF's
pedigree  was tangible, I  could point to him and  say "that man has kept this
thing running  all  these  years and you  don't do  that unless you  genuinely
believe in it!"

   You see his name all  over the SDF in  manpages,  com dumps, ASCII  network
diagrams  and  who  knows what else,  and that  belief  that no one  would  do
something so thankless for so long unless they were genuinely passionate about
it in turn makes me  passionate. It makes me want to be a part if it and makes
me want to help out in any way I can.

   To me, smj IS the SDF.

   With him gone and the reigns handed over to someone who to my knowledge had
already abandoned the  system once, I feel like the pedigree is  just history,
the SDF in my mind becomes a "was" instead of an "is".

   I'll admit  iczer and I got off  on  the wrong foot but  when literally the
first message I ever see from him is his complaining about how shit the SDF is
and then later, vague threats about being banned for 40 years or whatever  the
fuck, what am I supposed to think?

   Now take a look at the community on SDF. The only communities that are SDF-
specific are com and bboard, the IRC and Mastodon while mostly SDF members are
not  SDF exclusive and  both can be used even without an SDF  membership.  You
could argue  that happening  and profiles  kinda count  and  maybe  the gopher
spaces too but whatever.

   For  a system that boasts "about 30,000 members" you barely see more than a
dozen  names in the community and in the case of com the vast majority of that
tiny fraction are perpetually  idle.  So  now, with the SDF's pedigree fading,
what  is the real appeal of its  tiny active community  beyond the novelty  of
being a secret  clubhouse for two or three users to  gossip and snark-out  any
newcomers?

   I just don't know anymore.

   There  are so  many other  PUBLIX communities  out there that are far  more
engaged  and far more transparent about what's going on behind the scenes. The
SDF  has all  the toys  but there's always  communities  building  their  own.
circumlunar.space has it's com and bboard analogs, tilde.town has bbj and I've
got no doubt some upstart is working  on some kind of tildeverse-inspired VoIP
concept.

   Yes the SDF boasts "Imitators come and go -  SDF exceeds them all" but what
is the point of just living longer  if  it's  a life  that's become  devoid of
purpose?

   I'm rambling but let me tell you a quick story before I close this file.

   Before I was on the SDF properly I was on another PUBLIX system, I actually
found out  about  the  SDF  through them  in an  unpleasant,  round-about way.
Anyway, they were  small but  had  been around  for  a good while.  They had a
pretty similar philosophy as the SDF and  a pretty similar history in terms of
administration,  in that  a founder and original sysop lost  interest and left
while the system continued on, evolved and grew under someone else. The system
never got huge but plodded along and even after I'd bailed for the SDF I had a
soft-spot for it so I'd  still log in  every  now and then to check in and see
what was happening.

   Earlier this  year  they had  a catastrophic failure and were struggling to
recover from  it and during that time the  founder reappeared, joking that  he
was surprised the thing still exists but offering to take back the sysop role.

   The  system is gone now and while  I have no idea  what  went on behind the
scenes  it  left me wondering  if they chose to see the end of  what  they had
built rather than hand it over to someone who had already abandoned it once.
