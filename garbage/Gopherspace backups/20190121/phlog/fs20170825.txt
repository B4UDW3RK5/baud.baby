   So, uh, I guess  Danielle and I joined an  /        _/         /         / 
anime club?                                   \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_

   Showing my age here but  the  last time I   /        _/         /_       _/
was in an anime club was almost 20 years ago  /-        /        _/         /
when the  Melbourne Anime  Society was still  \________/\________/\___/____/
around and still met out in Oakleigh. I left
a little while after they moved out to Monash Clayton because  it was starting
to feel like too  much  of a chore to get  all the  way  out there  and  I was
starting to get most  of my tapes through trades with friends  rather than the
club. Not to mention it was starting to get easier to find stuff online.

   To be honest I can't even remember the  last  time  I even actively watched
anime? Probably when Knights of Sidonia started? I dunno.

   I'm a little apprehensive  because  of my age;  the  anime crowd just keeps
getting   younger,  man,  and  I  just  keep  getting  older.  Going  by   the
introductions thread on their website it looks like there might be some lifers
in the group though, so maybe it'll be ok? Also thinking back on the MAS days,
the  president  would have been in  his late 20s at least and the librarian at
the time was pushing 50 but that was also a really different time. I sometimes
wonder what the hardcore eggs back then would think of how popular  and common
anime is these days.

   In what I'm assuming is a side effect  of  joining a  club, the anime  gods
have noticed me again and have announced a new Fireball series called Fireball
Humorous  and  a  new  Drossel.  I'm  very excited, ask me  about  my  Drossel
collection sometime.

   Our first meeting is in a couple weeks, I'll keep y'all posted.
