   Usually I can fire this up and just start
typing and something will come but it doesn't seem to be working lately.

   Yesterday was an  especially bad  day  but Danielle  surprised me with some
donuts and decorations and flowers  and lots of nice  things  so that helped a
lot, she really is the best and I'm super lucky to have her.

   Sunday I had a  minor meltdown while  out because of some  company's poorly
thought  out stunt about whatever. I get genuinely offended  when corporations
try to speak for  me, even if I agree with  what they're saying, and when they
try to speak to me "person"  to person. Mostly though I just got frustrated at
myself that I slipped up, I didn't recognise what was happening and walk away.
I really, actively try to avoid bullshit but so many people these days seem to
wear  their  bullshit  on  their  sleeves.  They  revel  and roll  in  it  and
shamelessly try to drag you into their mess.

   It sounds petty to grumble about it, I know, but the mechanism  just really
gets under my  skin. Advertising is poison to me and I don't  care  if  you're
advertising the key to world peace or if you're  advertising white  supremacy,
both fuck me off in equal measure.

   Anyway, I forget where I was going with this. Fuck it. End.
