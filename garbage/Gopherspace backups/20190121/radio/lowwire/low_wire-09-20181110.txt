Phew! One last industrial show  before I switch  over to  a bunch of different
kinds of (mostly hipster) metal and  maybe  some hardcore punk for the rest of
November. Make sure stay tuned for that, sports fans!

Big thank you to everyone who  dropped in and chatted  in com and IRC, and  if
you missed the live show you can always catch the archive.

If you  missed the announcement, I now have a  second show at 21:00 UTC Friday
on  tilderadio.org  called  "Soft  Ash"  that  plays  exclusively  goth  rock,
darkwave, neoclassical and the like. I've added a section for  it on baud.baby
and will probably do a FAX SEX file about it in the coming days.
