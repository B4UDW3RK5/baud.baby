Thank  you  to everyone who  tuned  in live to the inaugural episode of my new
regular live show on Tildeverse Radio: "Soft Ash".

For people  who weren't able to make it or missed out on the news, unlike  LOW
WIRE's   eclectic  whatever-I-feel-like   musical   mix,   Soft  Ash  will  be
predominantly darkwave, goth rock, neoclassical  and similar genres, tonight I
played just a loosey-goosey mix of old and new stuff.

My mic settings were quiet  at the  start and  a bit goofy throughout but I'll
have a look at that and try and figure out what happened.  There is an archive
but it's all still a work in progress  so we lost the first song, I think that
was my end weirding out though.
