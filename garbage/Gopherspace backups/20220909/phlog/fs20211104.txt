   I enjoy the  experience  and in a way  it  \________/\________/\___/____/
feels like finding a missing puzzle piece of
my identity, online and offline. 

   I've always  leaned  heavily  into technology  like a curious child, be  it
computers  or  telephones or  the  Internet  and VR/AR  feels like it's  going
through a very familiar evolutionary period.

   We had our early days of clunky  trial and error, false  starts and stalled
engines  that I'm sure we'll look  back  on fondly  through  nostalgia's  rose
tinted goggles but now, the technology we're playing with, the ease of use and
the reduced barrier to entry  glows like an exciting  new horizon, an unmapped
country. VR today is to VR tomorrow  what the early days of the Internet  were
to today's ubiquitous  digital communications  miasma. Jerry and David's guide
to the World Wide Web and 100 free  hours from AOL all contained  on this free
floppy disk!

   "Have you ever got on-line?"

   I've been struggling  to find a home for myself in that  world, I've  tried
here and there to nest or cuddle up to a welcoming  tribe but the headset gets
heavy or you start to feel the tickle of a sweat drop and the spell is broken.

   I don't think my  needs are  unusual,  a quiet  space  is not a big  ask. A
pretty space  is not  a big ask. A functioning  space is not a big ask  but  I
still have yet to find the right fit. The glass slipper for my dainty foot.

   Last night I had some  luck. Tethered  to my dear Creep, together  we found
OVR Toolkit[1], an application intended for streamers if I remember correctly,
that lets you pluck  individual  windows from your Windows  desktop and  bring
them into your VR experience as an overlay.

   It worked  well out of the box and with some finessing  it should be a real
contender for a comfortable VR workflow but I needed  somewhere to put it. OVR
Toolkit was my notebook and pen but what could I use as a desk?

   I dove into VRChat[2], not really expecting it to be the resource I needed,
it was more out of  familiarity.  I knew how to change  my look and how to get
around and  it didn't  have any  action I needed  to pay attention  to while I
fiddled  with my  settings. I still had  my  avatar with me from  last time  I
fooled around in there and went into  The Black Cat for some ambience  but the
people milling around, doing their thing made me anxious.

   I dipped out and went searching for somewhere private. I think I could have
spawned my own instance  of The Black Cat or whatever but that  seems  lonely,
not comfy.

   Browsing around, I found an  interesting space depicting  the explosion and
singularity  at the end  of AKIRA[3]. It was based on the manga and  visuallly
appealing but kind of ominous and, if I'm honest, the designer intended for it
to be a room for a club or rave so that put me off somewhat.

   The manga aesthetic tumbled me down a  rabbit hole of minimalist, black and
white worlds and then, when I finally righted myself I stood in the tall grass
of Dephy's Pale Tree[4], surrounded  by black nothing, comforted by The Silver
Mt. Zion Memorial  Orchestra[5], and in the  shadow of that  tree I pulled  my
terminals and textfiles and  browsers up around me like a quilt. Practical and
beautiful and comfortable.
