   A  week  or  so back kvothe wrote a  neat  /        _/         /         /
phlog post[1] about the beauty of plain text  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
formatting,  a  sentiment I very much share,    /        \/        \/    /   \
and the efforts  they're  making  to  format   /        _/         /_       _/
their phlog posts.                            /-        /        _/         /

   In  the post, kvothe also calls  out  FAX
SEX as  an example of  artistry in  the medium  which is sincerely flattering,
thank you.

   They  conclude by wondering how I get the  FAX SEX logo on each of my posts
and, let me tell ya,  like most magician's secrets the reveal will disappoint:
The trick  to it is that  I do it all by  hand with some template files  and a
text editor. Justify the text by hand, indent the  paragraphs by hand and then
add the  logo by hand. If I want to make  a change to a post I have to go back
and reformat the paragraph by hand and the few times I decided  to  change  or
tweak the layout I went back and re-did every post by hand.

   My  background is closer to the art and graphic design end of  the spectrum
than developer  so, while  I will take  a swing  at scripting  and  automating
things once in a while,  my default  mode is to craft the thing  itself rather
than to craft a tool to craft the thing for me.

   I think of it as "artisanal phlogging," hahahaha.

   I'm kidding.
