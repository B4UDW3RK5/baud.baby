I promised metal and metal is what we shall have: a solid hour of  atmospheric
black metal, as bleak and as dark as the cold depths of space!

I tried to transition out of the second-to-last  track early but  fat-fingered
it a bit  so there's a second where the volume jumps around a  little. No harm
done though. As  always,  a sincere thank you to everyone who tuned in for the
live show,  especially  people who  normally wouldn't  sit through music  like
this, it's nice to be able to share  with open-minded people, even if  they go
away thinking "wow, I didn't like that at all" hahaha.

If you missed it  you can catch  the  archive on aNONradio.net and I thank you
for listening there too.

During the show I noted that there was another track  that  I would have liked
to include but thematically it didn't fit so instead I opted to play it during
the OpenMic block. I've left a link  for that one in  the Meta section for you
in case you'd like to check it out, it's really something.
