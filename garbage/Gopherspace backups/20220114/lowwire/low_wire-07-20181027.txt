A  thundering mix of  industrial  rock, machine  rock  and  coldwave  for your
Saturday night! There was a little drama and a little tension earlier but,  at
the  end of the day LOW  WIRE  goes on and  I'm still a part of this wonderful
underground  radio community!  Big  thank you to the tilderadio.org  guys  for
allowing  me to  continue my stream there  if  I wasn’t  able  to  resolve  my
aNONradio login  issues, this  show was simulcast on both channels and it went
off swimmingly.  Going forward LOW  WIRE will remain  an aNONradio show but  I
have no doubt you’ll see me spinning up something regular for Tildeverse Radio
before too long so stay tuned! Long live underground radio!

Sincerely, thank you to everyone who tuned in live, between  the two streams I
hit a  new  record  for me of  ~26 peak listeners which is amazing.  And don't
forget, if you missed it live you can always catch the archive.
