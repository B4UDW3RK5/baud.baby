Export Orders for Touchfone

Alcatel STC has scored what is believed to be the first export sales of the new
Australian-designed and manufactured telephone, the Touchfone 200. Sales are to
Papua New Guinea and to Western Samoa. The company has also scored sales of its
pay-telephone Gold Phone to Fiji.

The total value of these three orders amounts to almost $600,000.

The Touchfone 200 was the result of a  joint development which involved Alcatel
STC and Telecom. It is now being distributed in Australia as Telecom's standard
domestic telephone. The advanced  unit has  also  been accepted for use  in the
telephone systems of North America.

"The  research  and development effort which  went  into the  Touchfone 200 was
planned with an eye on export sales",  said Spencer Bell, Marketing Director of
Alcatel STC. "The effort is beginning to pay off. We are sure this is the first
of many export orders for the product."
