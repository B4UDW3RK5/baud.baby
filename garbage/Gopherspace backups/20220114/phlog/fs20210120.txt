important?  This is old news  to friends  on  \________/\________/\___/____/
IRC  or Fedi  but  Danicat are  pregnant. At
time of writing we're at 19 weeks in so  not sure about gender or anything yet
but we're nailing the health tests.

   I'm so excited to be a dad, but equally  scared. I feel confident I will do
a good job. We daydream about "what if" scenarios  and stuff about our child's
personality but  in reality we're  excited to see how their  personality grows
and what their wants and interests are.

   Being pregnant and on Gopher  reminded me of something I found  down in the
guts of the SDF Gopher  space when I was  digging around  a long while back, I
think I  shared this  on a Fedi account now deleted. A few simple, sweet notes
from a father for his daughter.[1]

   Jeez what else...

   I've relocated from Melbourne to Adelaide, initially  it was to be close to
my family  because my  grandmother's  health was in  very bad shape. Sadly she
passed just  before we moved over so we weren't able to be close  for that but
we're here nontheless and, with the impact of the pandemic I still consider it
a good move. We got lucky and  made our move before  things got really bad, my
general paranoia paid off in this case.

   I think that's  about all I've  got? Seems very brief  considering how long
it's been between  posts. The status of tilde.tel I covered in a previous post
(and has since  been disabled[2])  but aside  from that I haven't  got much to
report.  baudVision is  down and  has  been  down  for some  time - I  started
rebuilding  it a little  while back  and it's going  well but I  lost traction
while I worked on other stuff and did life and haven't found the motivation to
dive back in.

   Oh and baud.baby's whole gopher hole got a  beautiful redesign but I'm sure
y'all would have seen that already.
