   Microdosing carries on, this is my  first   /        _/         /_       _/
day on the  quarter  dose of a  60ug tab and  /-        /        _/         /
shit's  all cool  so  far  but I'm kinda  on  \________/\________/\___/____/
high-alert   for  any  weirdness.  A  little
worried because the dose  is a physically larger piece of the tab so if it was
laid lop-sided there's a bigger chance of my world getting wobbly.

   Friday I finally got to link up with some friends after  about ten thousand
aborted attempts, we're all busy unfortunately so organising stuff is hard. We
got a bit  derailed because of the public holiday,  we wanted to  check out  a
pinball  bar here and that was closed so we went to Pixel Alley  instead which
should have been open, according to their Facebook page but weren't so we were
kinda lost. I was a bit frustrated but  we decided  to check out  a  bar/pizza
joint  called  Lazerpig  and I'm  glad  we  did,  it's  cozy  and  has  a nice
atmosphere, the pizza was really good and they had Mash's Copycat AIPA on tap.

   I came clean about the dosing, I'd mentioned it to them  once before asking
what they thought of it but hadn't  told them I was already planning on trying
it. The reaction  was  about  what  I expected; some interest,  only  a little
drugs-r-bad and  throwing out  a few gotchas to trip me up.  I took it all  in
stride hahaha.

   After that we bounced to a new place called BAR SK which styles itself as a
"small bar and gallery space for  new and playful media" - it  was a cute bar!
It reminded me  of Forgotten Worlds a little bit but much less genuine and  no
arcade  machines, instead  they had like  loosely  videogamey interactive  art
installations. SK felt like a place that was put together, especially the very
manufactured-looking video game  bathroom  graffiti,  whereas Forgotten Worlds
felt like a place that evolved organically. It was a really nice space though,
and the staff were really welcoming, I'll definitely  be  back another day.  I
was surprised how comfortable  I felt  chatting with  the guys there, I  don't
feel like I'm free from the usual anxiety and stuff but I feel like I can push
through it? It's hard to put into words, I'll have to think about it.

   We  spent  some time playing a  hilariously  silly AFL game  on NES (It was
Grand Final weekend here)  and  I  had a KAIJU!  Double IPA which is one of my
favorite  beers of all time  but probably a  bad idea after the beer I already
had because it's reasonably strong.  I was pretty wobbly after that but having
a good time.

   After that we  caught a tram back into  the  city because  there was  a new
eSports bar  I  wanted  to  check  out  called  GG-EZ,  it  was  really  neat!
Underground but  big  and open,  with screens on all the walls showing various
game  streams. The  staff were  friendly and the  whole atmosphere  was really
nice.  It'll be a fun place to go to come BlizzcCon and  the StarCraft II  WCS
Global Finals, I hope it's around for a while.

   There  I  bumped into  someone  I knew  from  the  Twitter  days,  she's  a
moderately  popular Twitch streamer  now.  I bumped into  her  once before  at
Forgotten Worlds  and she gets an obtuse  mention  in the phlog I posted about
Forgotten Worlds  back in July. Here's where, internally,  I did a real double
take at my behaviour. I was able to go over, say hi and  casually talk to her,
even though she was with her friends I didn't know and without anyone propping
me up, it felt simultaneously so alien and so natural haha.

   And I know what you're thinking; "Well, Cat, you were fuckin' drunk, lad" -
but that's never been the case, I can be staggering  and slurring  and I still
be shy and socially anxious, this was different and felt like a  real tangible
improvement  in my  mental health. It  felt  good. I  wonder if  she  noticed?
Actually, I wonder if my  friends  noticed? In hindsight I wish I  hadn't told
them about the microdosing  and just asked if they noticed a difference  in my
mood and behaviour.

   We  talked  for a bit  about  long distance  relationships  and life  after
Twitter and her studying  JavaScript  and  my trying to study  Python, it  was
really great. I bitch about Twitter being a dumpster fire and it absolutely is
but it wasn't always and I genuinely miss some of the friends I made there.

   After that we hit up my local barcade, Bartronica which, I dunno, I like it
there but it always seems hit  and miss. I either have a really good time or I
have a crummy time. This time it wasn't so bad, we got some beers and played a
couple games but mostly just hung out and talked. We left a little while later
to get a burger and sat around chatting until we got kicked out hahaha.

   The guys were thinking about leaving  but I  wanted to  play a little  more
because I hadn't really done much and it's so hard for us to organise anything
I wanted to  make the most  of it but when we rolled back to Bartronica they'd
bumped  the music up  to  11  and the  whole  environment  was pretty  shitty,
couldn't talk, could barely think,  so we bounced immediately and that was it,
the fun sucked out of it. We walked back to my building and called it a night.

   It was a  good night  overall, though, at least for me. Things are going so
well for my  mental  health  right now and  it felt really good to be able  to
lower shields a little for the first time in what feels like forever.
