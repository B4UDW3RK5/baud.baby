Something really special this week, I reached out to tomasino and asked him to
provide some short spoken tabletop RPG style vignettes to add a  bit of flavor
to  Kingdom of Soft Ash.  He  obliged  with some excellent  readings  from the
introduction to D&D adventure; Escape from Zanzer's Dungeon.

Huge  thanks to tomasino for helping out with this,  please check out his show
every Sunday at 23:00 UTC on  both tilderadio.org and anonradio.net,  he reads
Choose Your Own  Adventure books live and  you  can participate by making  the
choices.

Also make sure you peep his gopher content on gopher.black!

And thank you to everyone who tuned in live,  it was one of the  best-received
Soft  Ash streams  yet and I'm  glad people enjoyed  it  as much  as I enjoyed
putting it together. I don't know how I'm going to top it for next week, to be
honest!
