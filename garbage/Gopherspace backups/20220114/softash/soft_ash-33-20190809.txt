Something special this week! The first  half of  the set was  me just  playing
whatever, came out pretty good, but the  second half  was a collaboration with
poet  from tilde.black,  he provided some poetry  readings and  I laid it over
some glitchy ambient, deep drone and sound collage.

I've gotta make some  space on  here for archives of the  collaboration  shows
somewhere I think, I'm not fussed about  most of the archives but this one and
the one tomasino contributed to should be preserved.
