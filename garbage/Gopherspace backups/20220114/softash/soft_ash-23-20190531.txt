I'm  back baby! Soft Ash is dead but I'm still here, same Cat,  same timeslot.
For the  time being I'm  operating without a  show name, without any  kind  of
concept or plan, I'm just going to play whatever  is on my mind. Consider this
LOW WIRE redux.

This week I played  a bunch of  bombastic machine  rock, industrial  rock  and
coldwave and had a very good time. See you next week!
