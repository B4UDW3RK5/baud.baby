As we reach the end of Kingdom of Soft Ash things come full circle and we dive
in to the black metal intros and outros that inspired a genre.

Thank you to everyone who's joined me on this journey!

As  mentioned in the show, next week will be a  similar  but different ambient
genre and then I'm likely on hiatus until after the wedding.
