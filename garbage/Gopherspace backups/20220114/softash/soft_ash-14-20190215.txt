Damn these playlists are so late, I can barely remember what I did, when I did
it and why!  Anyway,  there  was no Soft Ash the week  before this one because
life attacked but this was  a  fun playlist of horror punk! Thanks to everyone
who tuned in and chatted. Did I really play two The Dead Next Door tracks back
to back? Perhaps I did! I don't remember.

There's a  long  Darkest of the Hillside  Thickets track as a kind of bonus at
the end, I love that track but it didn't really fit with the show.

If you check out the archive for this one, the audio is  kinda wiggy in spots,
apologies for that.
