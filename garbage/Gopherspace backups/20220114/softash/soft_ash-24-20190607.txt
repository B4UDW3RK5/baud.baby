Phew. Circled right  back  around  to what got  me started  with this internet
radio nonsense; a long, mellow  witch house stream.  Ran  two hours instead of
one, playing all kinds of deep drones and 808 claps.

I imagine this text file will look like a  total mess because of all the weird
characters in it.

As an aside, I need to find a way to try and improve engagement on this thing,
it's  fun  to  stream  to  friends  but  averaging 3-4  listeners  is  kind of
disheartening and  leaves me wondering why I bother. It's time  that could  be
spent on other projects or, in my case, sleeping in.

Will see how it turns out but it might be that I either rethink my timeslot or
give up a slot and just do ad-hoc streams going forward.
