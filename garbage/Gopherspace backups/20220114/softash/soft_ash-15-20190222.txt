This is  it, the last Soft  As  as we know it, from March 1  Soft Ash will  be
transformed into something new and different. Exciting!

We leave as we came in; with some good, old-fashioned goth rock. Like the week
before, I threw in an extra track at the end.

As always, thank you so much  to everyone who  tuned in and goofed off in  the
chat.
