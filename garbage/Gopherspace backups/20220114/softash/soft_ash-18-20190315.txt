This week  I  try  to journey into the blippier and bloopier  realm of dungeon
synth, the  tracks that evoke memories of SSI RPGs and Sierra adventure games.
I even slipped a couple of video game tracks in, did anyone notice?

As always, thank you so  much to everyone who listened live  and thank YOU for
listening to the archive.
