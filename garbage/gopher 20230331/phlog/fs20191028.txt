   Oh and speaking of; I was inspired by the
impeccable  brool[1] to start my own  "secret" side-phlog. You can find it  on
tilde.black under  the user "genin"[2]  but make sure you use cgo[3]  or, in a
pinch, vf1[4] for the full effect because it's a fucking masterpiece.

   Anyway, I've  got a lot I want to do but first cab off the rank  has  to be
~tel work. What  was once  my  pride  and joy  is  so neglected  that  I  feel
embarrassed to  even  talk  about  it, to  try and not draw  attention to  how
inactive I've been. But now I'm back! I've  merged in the 1900s extensions I'd
missed and updated some  bits and pieces behind the scenes but here's what I'm
aiming to have done by the end of the year:

    - Re-record all  the announcements.  There are  a  lot of  these so I'm
      going  to be  strategic  about it, recording the ones  we use now and
      then only re-recording the ones I need as I need them.

    - Fix operator! I'm  fiddling  with  archangelic's  pinhook[5]  but  am
      having some  trouble  getting past the first hurdle but once I've got
      the bot up and running baking in the Asterisk pieces shouldn't be any
      harder  than the old operator bot and from there  I can  build on  it
      further.

    - Improve the conference  bridge.  It's all very stock-standard  at the
      moment  and there's lots of  little  tweaks and additions to make  it
      more comfy.

    - C*NET integration. This has been my albatross and  is what completely
      shut  down  any  interest  I  had  in  ~tel.  It's   complicated  and
      frustratingly bulky. Just integrating their standard  dialplan didn't
      work  so I have to reverse engineer  it which  isn't hard,  dialplans
      aren't that difficult and you just need patience, but it feels like a
      mountain and has already thrown me off once.

    - URI dialing. This should  be  pretty simple and  yet I still  haven't
      done it.

    - Move  the gateways to  service numbers. Once the C*NET stuff is  done
      I'm going  to  move  the  SDF  and  Futel gateways  from the 1900s to
      service  numbers instead, that'll give us three gateways  out of ~tel
      and into other community/hobbyist networks.

   Basically a great big list of shit I should have already done but noped out
because I didn't figure it out immediately.

   So  that's ~tel, but what  else? November 9  is my  one-year anniversary at
TildeRadio and I've decided to call it a day. I gave it a good  try, showed up
every week or made apologies when I couldn't, but there's been no growth. I've
done what I can  but with a near-zero social/web presence it makes it  tricky,
any time  I try and push to get more traction I'm doing so to a small group of
people who already  know  what  TildeRadio is and aren't interested so at this
point it feels like I'm just beating a dead horse.

   I'll definitely still be around and streaming  this or that  for TildeRadio
whenever the mood strikes me, but I won't  be channeling orgone  into prepping
playlists and stuff for a weekly show anymore.

   That still means  there's two shows left, tune  in if you can!  Fridays  at
2100 UTC on tilderadio.org - hope to see you there.

   So where  will I be  redirecting that  energy?  Well  I'd like to get  that
regular ~tel/TildeRadio  OpenVoIP analog up and running, it's been in the back
of my mind  for  a  while but haven't put shoulder to  wheel on it in any way,
it's long overdue. I'll have  to think of a  way to  make it its own thing and
not just a straight up copy of aNON's OpenVoIP but  we'll see how that goes so
stay tuned.

   Aside from that I've  got one other secret project already underway, though
it's a few  weeks off yet since there's a specific timing for it. I won't give
too many details but it's going to be cute and fun and very deep underground.

   That's about it! Some new junk  coming for baud.baby too  but that'll write
about that once it's done.

   See you around.
