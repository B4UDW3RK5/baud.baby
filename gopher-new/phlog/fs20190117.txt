   Last week moji brought  up the  idea of a    /        \/        \/    /   \
simple   "port   70"   sticker[1]  and   the   /        _/         /_       _/
phlogosphere  has responded with some really  /-        /        _/         /
good ones. I thought I'd throw my hat in the  \________/\________/\___/____/
ring   with   some  pretty  simple  designs,
including a couple  port 79 ones for the  finger crowd, which you can find  in
/files/stickers - they're pretty derivative, especially the oval  "country  of
registration" style ones, but I like the simplicity of them. I imagine them on
an office laptop or  slapped up around town, on sign posts and  phone  booths,
with no context. A secret nod to those in the know.

   One thing  I do think they're missing  though is there's nothing about them
that says "this is computer related" so I'm going to take a couple more swings
at it  with that in mind and see what shakes loose. I'd also like to introduce
some color,  though  black  and  white  always  looks  more  striking  to  me.
Especially if you're coming  at it from  a street  art kind of  angle, a  bold
black and  white sticker really  jumps  out when  you  throw  it  on  top of a
Technicolor jumble of accumulated stickers.

   Consider it a work in progress and keep your eyes peeled for more if you're
interested.

   That's about it. Wish I had more to report on other stuff I've been working
on  but between  the holidays,  wedding stuff, work draining my life, the heat
making it hard  to care  and my general, spectacular  laziness, I ain't really
done shit but  stream  and slouch around.  TildeTel is way  behind where I was
hoping  to be, not because  of any issue, just  because I'm  slack and  easily
distracted. A couple other  things are kinda slowly plodding along but I don't
want to talk about them, at least until ~tel is squared away.

   Will put  some muscle into  it this weekend  hopefully, but  I've said that
before hahaha.
