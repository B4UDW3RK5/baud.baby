Dani met me after  work and we headed off to  \________/\________/\___/____/
the  airport.  Not  much  to  say  about the
flight,  budget  airlines are budget airlines so it's  pretty much what  you'd
expect.

   Tuesday  was Ladybeard's  live and it was really  something special. It was
put on by the ARMI, which is the Australian Rock and Metal  Institute, a music
school founded in  2012  with a  lean  towards  rock/metal bands that has been
pretty  influential in  the Adelaide  metal  scene  and it was held in  an old
factory building that had been converted into a live music space.

   I  really liked the venue, it was  big and open  with high ceilings and the
stage was in one corner rather than against a wall, it was great. I could have
done without  the condescending snark from the staff about  how this "isn't  a
normal metal show", rattling on about how violent they get and blah blah blah.
On one hand, ok, there are a  lot more nerds in your space than you're used to
and you might be feeling  defensive about  it  but on the other hand; you're a
dick head.

   The  crowd was  very different  from the Melbourne  crowd, definitely  more
metal fans than Japanophiles and the support acts were straight up metal acts;
a  death metal group  called As  I  Destruct and a  metalcore group  called I,
Icarus.

   We wanted to be front row for Ladybeard so we ended  up just up against the
barrier for the whole show which was a lot of fun.

   As I Destruct were pretty good live, the singer had a lot of energy and the
guy  on lead guitar was pretty amazing.  Not  hugely into their sound, though,
they  seem like  a  group I'd enjoy  live  but  that  I'd  find  pretty boring
otherwise. I dunno.

   I, Icarus were  something else, they  were super energetic and their  sound
really clicked with the half-nerdy crowd. They were just kids, too, like late-
teens  or early 20s, hahaha. Made me feel fuckin' old. I dug them and will try
to catch them again if they're out this way. I  think they  were taken aback a
bit by the response they got, the audience was way into it.

   Then there was Ladybeard  and a couple songs into his normal set he brought
out  a live band,  made  up of ARMI students and one  of  the ARMI founders on
guitar which was pretty wild. He gave it 110%, the crowd was nuts and it was a
good show. He  did two Deadlift  Lolita  songs  this time  which  was  a  nice
surprise, in  all the other shows I think he's just done Pump  up Japan, there
were some other idol fans in the  mix but  I think  we were the only ones with
pen lights, we stand out like a neon sign in the photos from the live haha.

   After  the  show  there was  the usual meet and  greet, Dani and my  sister
dressed up  in matching costumes and got  photos with Ladybeard and we got one
with the three of us then headed home, exhausted.

   The day after we  attended the Adelaide screening of  Big in Japan  with my
sister  and it  was  also  a  good time. In a proper  cinema  this time out in
Glenelg and it was  a pretty nice one, I  had  a  really big soda and was in a
good mood. Had mixed feelings about the documentary the second time around and
it kinda left me in a weird headspace about Ladybeard. I dunno how to describe
it, you know how if you stare at something too long you start to notice little
cracks? Something  like  that. I have no doubt he's mostly genuine but there's
some stuff  that sort of  makes me feel more guarded in my fandom now I guess.
Some contradictions between what he says in different interviews and stuff. My
sister also had a very different  opinion  about the whole situation which got
gears turning. I'm glad I went to see it a second time.

   After  the screening was a Q&A but  one of  the  members was  unfortunately
missing as he  had somewhere  else  he had  a  funeral to attend  and that was
understandably  more  important  and after that one more meet  and  greet,  we
didn't  get photos this  time,  just took a moment  to say goodbye and get one
last  hug in.  Dani  got  kinda teary, demanding he get some  rest.  She's too
sweet.

   And that was  that,  we went home, via a bakery  for some late night treats
and  our Ladybeard  tour came to  an end.  Next  step I suppose will be seeing
Deadlift Lolita in Japan which I'm sure will be a very different experience!
