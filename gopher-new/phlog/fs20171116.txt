   Infinitely frustrated with work.  I  work  \________/\________/\___/____/
pretty  closely with a team who's job  it is
is to collate data and  provide  insights based on  that data but they are the
bane of my existence.

   I like real things. I like truths. I feel  like if  a = a  then you have to
accept that it is a, even if you expected it to be b and want it to be c. This
leads  to us clashing a  lot and always  leaves me really frustrated.  I can't
understand  how  people who's  role is  to  report on  what is happening can't
understand that they're not supposed to be making it up. It's baffling.

   A  recent example is a measure that should be  summarised by the state they
live in. Makes sense, works fine, but one person who lives in x had x in their
profile and they  wanted them to appear  in  y.  For a  second I  legitimately
couldn't understand what they were asking. If  this person lives in  x why the
fuck should their data appear in y?

   I'm not  crazy, right? I mean, if you're just going to make shit up why are
you fucking reporting on it at  all? Just throw some numbers in boxes. They do
this all the time, moving figures around so they "look right" even though they
WERE right. It hurts my head to think about.

   Since I'm rattling on, my other gripe is they always approach our team like
we're the ones who  have  no idea. In that same example above  they came to me
complaining that our  system was "broken" and "wrong" because it was reporting
accurately  on  the  information they provided  and not on their clumsy whims.
Fuck  off, man. It's  no  wonder  my whole  team scatters around  the building
rather than  sitting together in our designated space,  if these dildos  can't
find us we can actually get some work done.

   Anyway.

   Nothing much else  going on. All I do  is  work and  eat and sleep, my man.
Watching a lot of makers on Youtube in  the evenings  and  getting  frustrated
that  I have  no  space to  work in, most  things I want to do are dead in the
water because I  have nowhere to even plan things out, let alone start messing
with and assembling things. Only thing I  feel  like I'm working on these days
is a long list of things I'd like to work on.

   Trying  to  find  anything  better  is  crushing,  everything  is just  too
expensive unless we move way out into the suburbs.

   Blah.

   I feel trapped by life.
