   As at writing this I've got a real swerve  /        _/         /         /
on and I've  fallen  into the  wildest  ASMR  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_

   ASMR  has  never  really been something I  /-        /        _/         /
was interested in,  the few times it came up  \________/\________/\___/____/
was because of something weird, like someone
eating and smacking their lips a whole bunch or a lady sticking her fingers in
slime and it just sounded weird and gross to me.

   But then  I  was  looking  at  some  room  ambience  video  for  ideas  for
KONPEIT-*record scratch*

   Oh yeah fuck I was supposed to do a  file about that wasn't I  whoops.  Ok.
Let me bring you up to speed.

   Way back  last week I dropped a テトラ実験室 product into the Gemini space, it
is called KONPEITO, all caps or abbreviated as  ***. It's basically a place to
distribute two sets  of mixtapes; one regularly but  infrequently released and
one released whenever but possibly more frequently.  Check it out, you'll need
a  gemini  browser,  I  recommend  solderpunks  av-98[1],  then  point  it  at
gemini://konpeito.media.

   Feedback has been really encouraging so far, I hope you enjoy.

   So back to this ASMR stuff.  The second you click on one ASMR YouTube video
your recommendations are immediately  bombarded  with them, like a  rash, it's
crazy, but  some of them  seemed  kind of weird and interesting  so I  clicked
around a bit.

   I got on a journey of ladies talking to the viewer while  they  do stuff, a
kind role play scenario where the lady was a receptionist or a train conductor
or whatever  and  then into one's  where they were a  doctor or barber. That's
where it got interesting because ones started to turn up  where the viewer was
a machine or robot that the ASMR girl was servicing.

   It still  seemed kinda goofy until I  was watching  this one[2]. I  skipped
ahead and suddenly she had this weird contraption[3] and  I was like "oh is it
a prop?" - you know, like  she took your ears out  to repair them or something
because  you're  a robot  but when I realized it was  wired for sound  it  all
finally clicked, it  was  basically  a  musical  instrument. It was crazy.  It
totally changed  the way I enjoyed  it, the whole thing started  feeling  like
weird, minimalist spoken word and noise music.

   I  watched the rest of  the video with my eyes closed and just got lost  in
it, it was very interesting and I highly recommend it.

   That's it!

   Oh wait, also I put  up  an old school  30-second-timer office webcam up on
the  baby, check it out from the main  menu, you might even  see  my shuffling
corpse!

   TTFN
