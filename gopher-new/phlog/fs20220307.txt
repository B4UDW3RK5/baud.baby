with me  on Fedi  you know that I have  been  /-        /        _/         /
running really hot since December. Something  \________/\________/\___/____/
interesting  happened  on my birthday and it
kind of lit a fire under me and I've been running off that energy since. Sadly
it's starting to dwindle and I'm settling back  into a routine of picking idly
at projects or being easily distracted. Before I'm creatively becalmed again I
want  to  get as  much stuff  across  the line as I can. Consider it my  final
sprint to the finish line.

   I'll dedicate a new phlog  post to each project  as it launches or at least
when it reaches close to done or when I feel like talking about it but first I
wanna cover some of the stuff you may have missed.

   Let's get the bad news out of the way first.  I've posted this already on a
few places but for  completeness  I'll mention it here too;  KONPEITO is over.
There's one  more "thank you" tape in the works but that'll be it.  I'll leave
the capsule up for now and give fair warning before I take it down but there's
not going to be any activity beyond that. My heart just wasn't in it this year
and it  didn't  seem right to  continue  it.  Thanks again to  everyone  who's
supported KONPEITO for the two years it ran.

   Ok on to better news. baudVision is back up and running after a long hiatus
and it's got way more drive space now.  I'm still ironing  out a few bugs with
VLC so it's falling  over every now and then but it's way better  than it was.
Working on just slamming it with content so keep an eye on it.

   And then there's the card game.

   The what?

   So there's this game I really love named  Cypher,  I've mentioend it in FAX
SEX before[1]  and I've always  thought the rules would work really well for a
game based on the movie Hackers and now that I have  some kind of supernatural
motivation I went ahead and did it. Let me tell you, it has been quite a saga,
and  one  that  is  still  ongoing.  I've  released  the game as  a  bunch  of
print-and-play which you can find here  on baud.baby or on my GitHub[2]  but I
also wanted  to get some professionally  printed copies  out there so I set it
all up on The Game Crafter  and,  womp womp,  they almost immediately  shut me
down for some imagined  intelelctual  property violation.  There was no actual
infringement  they just thought  there might be  or  something  like  that,  I
honestly don't know and couldn't get a straight answer out of them. In the end
I called them clowns and they decided that I was being disrespectful  and they
banned me. If you act like a clown I'm going to call you a clown, sorry.

   Weirdos.

   I've since been working with some manufacturing  companies to try and get a
run of  physical  copies  done but that's turning  out  to  be  a  much slower
process. Stay tuned for more info on that I guess.

   Lastly,   I  recycled  the  lurid.pink  domain  into  a  Web  site  for  my
street/sticker  art  alter ego iKU.  I'm on a  mission  this  year to try  and
improve the  visibility  of the bits and pieces  I make I under that name  and
re-establishing  an Instagram  account and setting up a  Web site  seemed like
logical steps.

   So that's  it,  that's about  where I'm at.  Lots of new stuff  on the way,
hopefully,  and I hope to inspire  some others to get the little projects that
have been eating that them out the door too.
