   Just  a  small note to  let y'all know  I  /        _/         /         /
posted a couple of free board games I really  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
like to  the  files  section  in  my  space.    /        \/        \/    /   \
Neither of the games are by  me but I hope I   /        _/         /_       _/
contributed  something  at  least  a  little  /-        /        _/         /
worthwhile  to them  by ASCIIfying  the Iso-  \________/\________/\___/____/
Path  rules,   putting  together   the   PDF
rulebook for Gnostica and sharing them both here.

   Iso-Path[1]  is  a  two  player board  game where the goal is  to reach the
opposing player's base at the opposite end of the board. White player can only
"climb" along stacks of hexagonal tiles and black player can  only "dig" along
the gameboard, the rules are dead simple but the game is really addictive.

   Gnostica[2] is an abstract war  game where the territories are reporesented
by cards  from  a standard  tarot  deck,  with  each  card  or  suit providing
different  "powers", and the  armies reporesented  by pyramid  pieces  (Looney
Pyramids). This game is really great, it's a bit rules-heavy but not difficult
to learn and really enjoyable and the  use of tarot  to represent a "world" is
really interesting. The downside of this one is it can be a bit expensive; for
the price  of  a  tarot deck  and  a few Looney stashes  a  "free" game starts
costing not much less than your average boxed game.

   I hope you enjoy!
