iGnostica is an  abstract territory based war game. Tarot cards make	/	baud.baby	70
iup    the   often-changing   board,    and   players   use   Looney	/	baud.baby	70
iPyramids/Icehouse  pieces  to represent minions that control  those	/	baud.baby	70
iterritories. Every tarot card  has  a power, and when  a player has	/	baud.baby	70
ione  of his pieces  on a territory, he or she may  use the power of	/	baud.baby	70
ithat  territory through  that piece.  Players also have  a  hand of	/	baud.baby	70
itarot  cards which allow them to  use  those powers  through any of	/	baud.baby	70
itheir pieces.  Territories are worth points when occupied,  and the	/	baud.baby	70
igame ends when  one player challenges the  other  players and has 9	/	baud.baby	70
ipoints on his or her following turn.	/	baud.baby	70

iStar Wheel is an  expansion of Gnostica, adding  materials from the	/	baud.baby	70
iastrological  game  Star  Encounters.  Homemade  components  and  a	/	baud.baby	70
iregular D12  easily substitute for the  Star Encounters properties.	/	baud.baby	70
iPlayer  tokens move  around  a  zodiac board  during  Gnostica, and	/	baud.baby	70
ienhance different card powers based on the player's position in the	/	baud.baby	70
izodiac. Additionally, players have the ability to roll  for a match	/	baud.baby	70
iwhich will award them extra card draws.	/	baud.baby	70
