Hi all! Look, this  isn't  easy, I  dunno,  but lately I feel  like
Gopher and  gopher  space is  becoming  too  mainstream.  I see new
phlogs popping up every day  and fucking Boing  Boing wrote  a damn
article about it. What's next, Buzzfeed listicles?

I'm out, I'm sorry.

I'm moving baud.baby and  FAX  SEX  deeper  underground.  I've been
speaking  to  some  people in the ATV (amateur television, not all-
terrain vehicle) community and going forward you'll only be able to
find my info on broadcast Teletext.

I have it working[1] but the range is wicked small and obstructed by
the clutter of the city so I guess my audience for the time-being is
limited to  people within 30-40  feet of my house. If you're outside
of that radius then, uh, so long? Haha.
