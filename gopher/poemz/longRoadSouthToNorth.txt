[long Road, South to North]

twin-lane highway
from point to curve
lowhills
shallow valley
a country I can never visit
a holy place I can never enter
you can never unwind a clock
to suit your heart

I travel the length of that place in my heart's eye
and find myself lost
in a warmth I can never hold in waking hours
