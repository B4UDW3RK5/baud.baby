[soft Spell]

she tiptoes in
wrapped in lurid pink ribbons
sticky-sweet and stomach soured
I'm lost in her touch
she cocoons me in the walls of my room, now hers
silent and womb-warm
fragrant white smoke envelops me
erases me
I am completely alone
the room is empty
she whispers, I am no-thing
she whispers, I am atoms moving through atoms
she whispers, I am hers
and I am hers
