   So here we are, two  years of  FAX SEX. I  /        _/         /         /
daydreamed  about  a  something  lengthy and  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
insightful  about   how  Gopher  space,  the    /        \/        \/    /   \
PUBNIX space and slow web movement has grown   /        _/         /_       _/
and changed  of the past two years but, hey,  /-        /        _/         /
after two years you know  I'm far more prone  \________/\________/\___/____/
to stumbling,  train-of-thought  rambling. I
figured it'd be remiss of me to not post on the two year anniversary so, strap
yourself in, here comes some stumbling, train-of- thought rambling.

   I wanna touch on the Gopher 2.0 chatter that's flying around at the moment.
Now y'all know I'm not much interested in the meta or Gopher shop-talk and I'm
slower  than most to  catch  up  but  what I always see  brought up  in  these
discussions; encryption,  markup and inline images, a protocol with  all these
features already exists. It's called the Web.

   "But cat, the Web is a hot mess dumpster fire!"

   This is true but also not true.

   I mean it is but it doesn't have to be. The web was once a wonderful place.
I remember when Yahoo! was curated by human beings, not algorithms. I remember
blogs written by people about their  lives,  not written  by influencers about
the products  they've  been  handed. I remember  when advertising  was  a rare
occurrence instead of the framework sites are built on.

   The  Web  as  a whole will never be that way again but the behemoths do not
own or control the Web, you can build within it, with discipline, a space that
echoes the  simplicity  of Gopher  and  build communities  of  like-minded and
disciplined people. Gopher exists separate from the web but that separation is
not really necessary, all you need is a space  to say "Here is where we do not
corrupt and here you  will find people who you can trust to do the  same"  and
people will build there. You already see this loosely within  the PUBNIX space
with people building "lo-fi" websites not out of any particular  motivation to
do so, just because it's the easiest way to get a page up to share your stuff.

   I advocate for fixing something that's broken instead of breaking something
that works fine. Gopher does what it's supposed to do, the Web, in my opinion,
does not.

   Anyway, here's to two years of old-Internet, anime, games, drugs, music and
putting  my foot in  my  mouth. Two  years  of  exclusive content for a "dead"
protocol that "nobody uses anymore". On to the next one.
