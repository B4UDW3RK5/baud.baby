   There  are  a  few  basic  rules  of  gun  /        _/         /         /
ownership,  or tenets or commandments if you  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
like. The  list and  number of  them differs    /        \/        \/    /   \
from person to person, club to club but they   /        _/         /_       _/
all  essentially   boil  down  to  the  same  /-        /        _/         /
concepts of safety and discipline.            \________/\________/\___/____/

   I  first heard them a few years ago,  I'm not a  gun  owner so just learned
about  them  in  passing  while  reading  about  something  else,  and two  in
particular resonated with me:

   "Never let the muzzle cover anything that you are not willing to destroy."

   "Be sure of your target and what is behind it."

   Strongly worded, simple common sense but somehow often forgotten. Guns  are
dangerous, they exist to damage, destroy or kill. No  matter  how familiar you
are with them or how  confident you  are in handling them, that is always what
they will be for. You could argue that a gun on display, a framed showpiece or
something serves a different purpose and I suppose  that's technically correct
but either  the gun is disabled, in which  case it's a gun-shaped sculpture or
it's not in which case if it ever were  to be used as a gun again the  purpose
above still applies.

   Anyway, I  bring all  this up because I  think  about  those two  rules  in
particular quite  a  bit and how they apply to anything with the  potential to
damage, destroy or kill. Including words.

   Unlike a gun though, that requires licensing, purchasing and some  skill to
use, we all have words  and they  take very little skill  to use. Everyone  is
essentially armed all the time and because of this, beyond the destruction you
have to be prepared to level on your target you have to also be prepared to in
turn be destroyed by it and likewise you  also have to be sure  of what behind
you that could also potentially be destroyed.

   Words  have always been  a weapon, that's nothing  new, but lately people's
recklessness  with them really  feels like it's getting out of control. People
soapbox  in the hopes someone will  disagree and  provide a  target  for their
words, people seek out things to get offended by as an excuse to assault other
people with  their words. In the  last few months I've seen people savage each
other  over  phantom slights that literally never happened, I've been passive-
aggressively  accused of some fabricated  offense or other by people I thought
were  friends  and  have seen  other,  long-time  friends recklessly  endanger
strangers over  a rude word, including  going as far as  suggesting contacting
their employer over hurt feelings online.

   In my case  I'm  lucky  to have my shit together enough  that this kind  of
toxicity, at least when levelled at  me doesn't  bother me too much and I just
walk  away from it, but it's so alien to me seeing people  level their weapons
at strangers,  or  at friends with  such savagery and without a single thought
given to the  harm their words are doing or the  collateral harm  their  words
could do to others around them, without a  single thought given to retaliatory
harm that  could be  levelled  at  themselves  and  those  around  them.  It's
incredibly hateful and poisonous  behaviour, regardless of how right you think
you are and how wrong you think the other is.

   I'm  not the type to argue for licensing or  anything stupid like  that but
it's pretty clear that as is the case with  guns, some people are  responsible
enough to have  access and some people get by because their gun is a showpiece
or  similar, but some people, a surprisingly large amount of them, need  their
access to guns restricted or taken away from them for their own safety and the
safety of  others. At the very least until they can  learn the basic tenets to
keep themselves and others safe:

   Never  let hateful  or  harmful words cover someone you are  not willing to
destroy or be destroyed by.

   Always be sure of  what is  behind your target and always be sure of what's
behind you.
