   let's  start  at  the  start,  this  year  \________/\________/\___/____/
started    pretty   tough,    my   job   was
excruciatingly  stressful  and not showing much sign of getting better but was
still paying  the bills so I was sticking  with it, mostly  out of inertia. to
add to that,  TDK was closing  in on two  years  old which is exciting,  she's
hitting milestone  after milestone  and developing incredibly  fast. I want to
say she's really advanced  but what dad doesn't think their kid isn't amazing?
hahaha. it means she's very high maintenance. needs lots of time and attention
and doesn't really understand compromise and patience yet.

   that was my basic high-stress day-to-day.

   then we got the news: Dani's dad had been diagnosed with stage four cancer.
it  started  in his pancreas  and spread  all over.  that  on top of his  body
already being slammed from a lifetime of chron's disease and other ailments
and then on top of that the medication/treatment associated with those has
thrashed his liver. a perfect storm of bad things.

   the initial outlook was grim, a year or two, completely heartbreaking,  but
they  were going  to run more tests to be sure  and then decide  on treatment.
while we waited  for the results we resolved  to make our way back over to the
United States and started planning that out.

   then the tests came back and sadly they were even worse.  in the space of a
week  we'd gone  from all the time in the world  to years  to live to probably
three to six months  and a general  diagnosis  that treatment  was not advised
because  the impact of chemotherapy  on his body would do more harm than good,
all we could do was make his life as comfortable as possible in the interim.

   we dropped everything.

   a week  after  getting  that news Dani  and TDK were  on a  plane  back  to
Washington  alone and I was staying  behind  to pack our lives  into boxes.  I
tried to negotiate with my employer to work remotely but they were unreceptive
so I had to quit. a career of 12 years gone in an instant. we had to break our
lease, leave our friends and family and most of our belongings.

   two weeks after Dani  and TDK left I was on a plane  to follow  them across
the Pacific.  a life now  derelict,  in total  free-fall, having  to trust the
promises of support until we get established would be honored.

   I've never  felt so helpless  in my whole life. I've always  been  fiercely
independent   and   capable   and  now  my  whole   existence   was  in  other
peoples' hands.

   it's been  really  hard and I  can't  even  comfortably  complain  about it
because what does it amount to?  what is all my fear and discomfort and stress
when weighted against what my father-in-law  must be going through and what my
wife has yet to go through?

   all I can do is keep moving forward, and keep patiently  swirling the filth
and mud in my pan until I catch a glitter of gold in the slurry.

   a treasure that I haver found is that what I've lost in income and autonomy
I've now gained  in time.  I have a lot of time  to  work  on my own junk  and
projects and daydreams.

   one idea I've circled  back on is the idea of an open co-working  space for
people like me that are isolated in their own office spaces but would like the
company of other people while they work.  either for background  chatter or to
engage with  on projects  or just to goof off with. we've kinda done  them off
and on but with no real regularity; Gibs on hackers.town  did office hours for
a bit and when I was in Washington  last  year,  dokuja, jns  and  I kept late
night vampire hours.

   doing things  that haphazardly  is proving tricky though, because we've all
got our own schedules and we're all on vastly different timezones  so what I'm
going to trial for B4UDW3RK5  is a scheduled set of office hours. times when I
will be  in the  group office  come hell or high-water,  even if I'm  in there
alone, and people can come and go as they please, participate if they like, or
just idle.

   in the future I'll advertise it more broadly, putting the details up on the
baby and maybe posting  on Fedi,  but for people  reading  FAX SEX  here's the
tentative details;


        WH4T]  B4UDW3RK5 0FF1CE H0UR5

       WH3R3]  https://meet.jit.si/B4UDW3RK5
               (if it asks for a password: TDK)

        WH3N]  Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday 22:00-0:00 Seattle time
               (you can check ya local time here[1])

         WHY]  to create a comfy space to hang out, talk shop, share finds or
               projects or just idle.

         H0W]  Jitsi Meet will should work through any browser but if you're
               using a PC I recommend this Electron application[2]. there's
               apps for your smartphone and dial in details if you're really
               remote but still interested in participating. you can give
               yourself an avatar using Gravatar. be as involved or as quiet
               as you like, it's up to you.


   there's already a nice,  small community  of hackers,  artists,  musicians,
tinkerers and characters growing around our comfy Jitsi co-working chats and I
hope to see you there, even if it's just to pop in and say "hi".
