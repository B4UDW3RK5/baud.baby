   (Audience:  Fucking hell is he going talk
about his busted SDF VoIP again?)

   No, smartass, my SDF VoIP works now.

   Recently  I  have been fiddling  with and  have  fallen  way  in  love with
Asterisk.

   When my SDF VoIP was busted  (Audience: Fuck!)  and  I initially thought it
was just the voicemail I figured ok, in  the  spirit of the SDF if it's busted
and  I can just roll my own I should  just do that so I started tinkering with
Asterix with some success,  it was actually really  easy to get up and running
and the basic  extensions/dialplan config is  straight  forward  enough that I
could get my head around a simple answering machine.

   In  the  end I got  sidetracked and made a  goofy  thing that  plays back a
random  90s Australian phone sex  ad (should still be running if  you  want to
punch in ext. 1999 or 1999@sip.sdf.org  or however  direct calls work) and got
busy with work and  life stuff before I could circle  back and finish adding a
voicemail box.

   The  novelty of  the  phone sex thing  wore off  pretty quick  though, it's
pretty  much a one-shot  gag, so I'm working  on a  couple of new  things; one
being an automated  dial-a-reading  tarot line, an idea pretty much  along the
same lines  but a bit more interesting and gives me an excuse to try to set up
some   IVR  options  (description   of   how  the   reading   works/start  the
reading/replay  reading,  etc)  and to figure out  how to pipe  in  background
music, either by automatically  conferencing in two extensions or by using the
chanspy whisper or whatever.

   Once I've got that figured out  there's  something else I want to try along
the same lines but less randomised and more interactive. We'll see.

   Coincidentally  I  recently found a  Telstra  touchfone  TF200 in  a thrift
store, I've wanted a Touchfone for ages, long before I  was active on the SDF,
just to have one around  because  they're really nostalgic for  me. I'd  spend
hours on one as a kid, talking AD&D and anime nonsense with friends.

   Shortly after that I found a TF400  in really good  condition and was like,
"well I always liked the TF400  better when I was a kid" so I got that one too
because it was a really good price but then, again, shortly after that I found
another TF400 for not as good a price but  complete with manual and speed dial
"memory cards" and all so I  picked that up too hahaha. I'll  probably on-sell
the first TF400 or donate it, it didn't cost much and is missing the cover for
the speed dial.

   I also have an eye out for the clever "hands free" bolt-on speakerphone for
the old Touchfone series.  I saw one pop up on eBay but the bidding  got a bit
too steep for me, which is fair enough since as far as I know they were pretty
rare. I only ever recall seeing  one in real life, in  a friends dad's  shed I
think it was.

   So anyway that all really snowballed and  is a thing now I guess,  at least
for  the time  being. I picked up a little  Cisco ATA so I  can use the phones
with a  real  VoIP provider or the SDF's  VoIP. It's pretty  nifty,  I'd never
messed with VoIP much at all but setting all this up was a lot of fun and I'll
admit, there was a  little rush of nostalgia for me when I  found the settings
to replicate the Australian dial tone. It's way nicer than the default US dial
tone (sorry guys haha).

   I've still got to  get my head around the rest of the settings on the thing
and keep plugging away at Asterisk  config ideas and  problem-solving but it's
definitely  keeping me really engaged in the  short bursts I can actually work
on any of it.
