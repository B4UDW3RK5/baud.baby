   1. When  did  you  first  get  interested
in technology?

   as a kid I was nerdy, I  liked space ships and aliens and the Transformers.
other boys liked  sports and firefighters and soldiers. but  I wasn't unusual,
that's just stuff kids like. when I was  about six or seven the high school my
aunt  was  attending  had an  open  day  and  part  of the  activities  was  a
demonstration of computer communication from the computer club. this is before
the Internet, and  before BBS really took  off, it was just  nerds showing off
their network, including realtime chat. I point to that exact moment, that was
when  the bug  bit  me  and I  knew  computers,  networks, communications  and
technology were what I wanted to do.


   2. Whats your favorite piece of technology of all time?

   the telephone.  it's fun,  it's intimate,  it's tactile,  it's intentional,
it's simple. I love a telephone.


   3. What's your favorite piece of technology right now?

   right now I'm really interested in upcycled and repurposed laptops.


   4. Name one cool piece of technology we'll have in 25 years

   personal robotics is about to go really  mental, mark my words. in 25 years
robots will be as normal as cars.


   the meme demands a tag and I  will oblige, I'd like to hear from dokuja[2],
bstuf[3] and tomasino[4].
