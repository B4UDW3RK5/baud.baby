motherfucker! baudVision has  been on hiatus  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
for who  knows how  long after I  decided to    /        \/        \/    /   \
rebuild it from the ground up and then never   /        _/         /_       _/
finished it because it got to be a drag.      /-        /        _/         /

   That turned out to  be a blessing though,
I lost so much traction with the effort I was making that I had to roll back a
bunch of  progress and  find better, simpler ways of doing things  and now  it
works gloriously! 

   Everything I wanted to be able to do from  day one works now; the playlists
are generated dynamically  so I can just dump files in the  hopper and they'll
be automagically  added to the  playlist and  the nowplaying finger  now works
too, thanks to jns[1] teaching me some DBus black magic.

   The URL has  changed slightly  since the last time  I wrote about it so now
you'll  need to point your media player at  http://baud.vision:21225 - you can
finger  nowplaying@baud.vision  for  the  name  of the  file  now  playing  or
info@baud.vision  for the  411  on  what's  going  on. You  can  also  hit  up
gopher://baud.vision for info too.

   The library is small but growing, we've got some  radical 80s BMX in there,
some  old  school  anime, some  music  videos, lots of old  tech/old  internet
oddities and all kinds of  weirdness. I've also made a real effort  to try and
salvage things from the pre-/early-YouTube  days, including a lot from the old
RantTV streams I mentioned in the original baudVision announcement[2].

   Tune  in,  enjoy, if  you have  any  feedback then  hit me up.  We have  an
official #baudVision channel on tilde.chat[3] if you're  into that kinda thing
otherwise find me wherever you can find me.
