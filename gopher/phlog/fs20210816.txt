   So a  while  back  I put out  a call  for  /        _/         /         /
people  to send stickers  too and got a real  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
good  response.  At the time  I was  like "I    /        \/        \/    /   \
should  get a PO box for trading  stuff" and   /        _/         /_       _/
then... and then I did nothing.               /-        /        _/         /
                                              \________/\________/\___/____/
   Until now!

   So I finally  got a PO box and you can  send things  there, the address  is
below.

   Cat K.
   PO BOX 191
   WOODVILLE
   SOUTH AUSTRALIA 5011
   AUSTRALIA

   Send me things, stickers, a postcard, old  pamphlets, a friendly letter, an
unfriendly letter, whatever,  but make sure you include an  address I can send
something back to and I'll send you something neat in reply.

   The first  ten or  so should  receive a  physical  KONPEITO omake tape. I'm
keeping the details under a lid for now but they're going to be very cute. I'm
currently waiting on the tapes from the dupe company, it's all very exciting.

   Hope to hear from y'all.
