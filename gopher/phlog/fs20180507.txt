   I feel boring writing stuff because to be  \________/\________/\___/____/
honest it's really a "chilling  with family"
kind  of trip  so  we're not doing much  to speak  of,  just lots of  talking,
eating, cruising around.

   Watching too much TV hahaha.

   Last Thursday, I think, we went out for dinner and drinks with my partner's
friends and it was  a wild  time. We hit up a nice Mexican cantina and then  a
barcade in the Admiral district.  The restaurant was nice, comfy  and the food
was really good and pretty reasonably priced,  it  was nice to have some salad
with dinner haha. I had a sandwich kind of  thing which was really good but in
hindsight of how good it was I should have got something else because it was a
pretty vanilla choice.

   The  Admiral district,  which is  like  west of Seattle, is really nice. It
felt comfy and safe and reminded me a bit of Port Adelaide in Australia.

   We met up with everyone over dinner when hit up a arcade named  Vidiot that
was  nearby. Now I'm biased here, I've seen my  perfect barcade so every other
barcade I visit is going to be held  to  an unfair standard but  I  did really
like Vidiot.

   I'm not sure how to summarize the venue, it's kind of weird. The front door
leads to a short corridor  and then  into  the  bar  proper which  is  nothing
unusual but  once you're in it's  a high-ceilinged  open room with  a bunch of
arcade machines  and a bar to one side  but past  the  bar  is  a weird pirate
themed room,  made to look like the  aftercastle of a ship and beyond  that is
another, smaller arcade room. It was pretty strange. The back wall of the main
room was all sliding windows too, so aside from the pirate ship part the whole
place felt like someone  had  just repurposed the  big  back  room  of  a  dry
cleaners.

   The bar staff were  friendly and  were nice enough to  take a  photo of the
Dorbz toys they were using as handles on the beer taps, he  said he's  done it
so many times that  he's  a pro. The machines they had were pretty solid, too.
Lots of multi-game machines which, although not authentic are really good in a
drunken,  casual  setting  when you just want  to play  games with friends and
don't give a  shit about being a purist. They also had plenty of racing games,
almost  a dozen  pinball tables  and  Virtual On:  Cyber  Troopers  which  was
fantastic,  I  hadn't  played  that  since probably  99  or  2000.  I'm  still
completely shit at it but I love it haha.

   Excluding the  pinball  tables,  all  the machines were  free to play, too,
something I've never seen in any of Melbourne's barcades, a really nice touch.

   The drinks were  nice  too,  I  just  had beer but they  had Black  Raven's
Trickster IPA on tap and I really  like that beer so I was more than happy. My
wife had a cocktail which, I dunno, it was nice but it lacked any subtlety, it
just  tasted  like  a  bunch  of  liquors thrown  together  haha. They weren't
unpleasant together but they didn't really blend, it tasted more like shooting
one after the other. It was also strong as heck.

   I  like my partner's friends  a  lot,  they're really great. The only one I
don't really get  along with is her ex, he used to  be  a bit of an asshat and
I'll admit he's a  lot less  grating than he used to be but he's  one of those
"gamers" - as in the kind of gamer funking up the games room at  a convention.
The kind of gamer hollering at children half their age at Pokemon tournaments.
The kind  of gamer with  no inside-voice,  no sense  of  boundaries and social
nuance, etc. I just avoided him though haha.

   After we played some games we piled into her  friends' car  to what? Smoke,
of course,  it's Washington! I  mentioned  back  when I was writing  about the
microdosing  that I don't really smoke all that often so when  I do that  shit
knocks me on my ass. Wife and I smoked a bit a couple days before she was fine
but I was knocked the fuck out, rolling  around on the bed nodding in and out.
I only  smoked  a bit when we were  out but I  had more than a few  drinks and
ended up all fucked up completely. 100% offline. Hahaha. I bailed from the car
for some fresh air and a local, I'm assuming, decided to snark at me about the
smell, "Smells like marijuana," she  said,  "I remember  when it smelled  like
coffee."

   Fuck off, dick head. I just grinned because I was on the moon oops haha.

   We talked shit for  a bit  then went our separate ways, one  of the friends
driving us home. A bit of background on her;  she smokes a lot and knows a lot
about it, she's basically a weed scientist, so if she says she's ok to drive I
trust her.

   She was ok to drive but she did have some trouble navigating haha.

   I don't know the  proper word for it but  I was  in  a state where,  though
completely trashed I could still kind of process what we were doing and it was
simultaneously frustrating and hilarious, one one hand I really just wanted to
be home not getting on and off the freeway endlessly but on the other  hand we
were  getting  on and  off the freeway  endlessly,  ducking in and out  of the
industrial and port districts and  it was  fucking hilarious.  At one point we
got  held up by  a train for a moment  and then the train  straight up stopped
across the road, we had to turn around.  All  the while  the GPS was gibbering
and the  friend driving was replying "Hm. Oh. Ok. Hm."  - it took us about  40
minutes to get to the bar, with traffic, it  took us just  under two hours  to
get home. Admittedly we had to drop another friend off on the  way but it  was
the early hours of the morning and there was literally no traffic, aside  from
that train.

   We did eventually make it  home  in one  piece though  and  it was a really
good, completely ridiculous night.
