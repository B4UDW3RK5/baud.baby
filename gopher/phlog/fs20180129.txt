stupid things I'm doing to my wetware huh?    \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_

   Firstly,  despite my  good  results going   /        _/         /_       _/
cold turkey from  caffeine and codeine  back  /-        /        _/         /
before I  started the microdosing, both have  \________/\________/\___/____/
crept back in. Caffeine I  didn't really put
up much of a fight against and I'm back on  my energy drink shit. I'm not real
fussed  about that, caffeine really  does  no harm unless you try to  quit it,
then it fucks with you for fun.

   Codeine I did try  and  fight, mostly  because it IS  bad for you  but also
because it's a chore to get  but it did creep back in, although not as much as
before. Addiction is what  it is, I  suppose and God it's just  so  comfy. Fun
times ahead for that though, the  drug  is changing schedules from  February 1
and will now require  a prescription instead of pharmacist approval. If you'll
indulge me a sec,  let me tell you how  fucking dumb  that decision is: really
fucking dumb. The crux of the argument  for that decision was that codeine can
cause dependence, and its misuse has led to addiction and even death.

   While  may be  true, you can  not argue that  something needs to be removed
because it's "addictive" when cigarettes and alcohol are still on the shelves.
At all.  Fuck  off.  Likewise, the statistics on  deaths caused by codeine are
pretty sketchy, it seems to be based on any death coded T402 which seems to be
catch-all  for any opioid that isn't  methadone or heroin  - the  majority  of
which are prescription drugs already, adding one more prescription to the pile
is not  going to  make any kind of dent in this. The statistics I've seen also
do not seem to contain any circumstances of death; whether  the deceased was a
long-time user, or  just a person with  a headache that  didn't know what they
were doing. Whether they had solely taken the drug or whether  they  were also
drinking or on other medication that may have caused complications.

   They're also backing up the decision with a  lot of poorly researched stuff
about codeine  being useless  in small doses and other pain killers being more
better but it's all bunk. Even the pharmacists themselves are calling bullshit
on all this  but the government  is  determined to go ahead with it. Australia
does pride itself on poorly planned knee-jerk policy.

   Anyway, enough legal drugs, let's talk about how the microdosing is going.

   Wait, one quick  aside; there's a legal  (read:  not illegal) analog to LSD
that quite a few microdosers in the States are using, that  I'm curious about.
Science upon science. Australia's analog  laws are really tough though so here
it's subject to the same restrictions as any other psychedelic drug.

   Ok so  it's been  up  and down. I continued with the 60ug  blotters while I
could and it was pretty great.  I fiddled with my dose a little bit  but ended
up sticking with a microdose around ~15ug.

   Then I made three mistakes.
 
   The first mistake was after I was unfortunately not able to get any more of
the blotters I was using, or even any other under-dosed blotters so I ended up
fishing around  for something else  and got  clumsy. I  got 135ug because they
seemed good but the vendor wasn't  one I'd used  before and I didn't bother to
test  them properly before using  them. They  haven't been  very good and I've
gone from  the microdosing  feeling  good-to-too-good to being  either bad  or
nothing.  Frustrating  since this  shit isn't  cheap but I guess  I  should be
thankful it wasn't worse.

   My second mistake was  thinking the 135ug blotters would  be  easy to  work
around, the plan was to dilute  it and dose from the solution  but the volumes
are  so low  and  it's so fiddly. The only way I could get it to  work  was to
REALLY dilute it and  hold  a big  ol'  blob of water in my mouth  for whoever
knows how  long.  It  wasn't  really practical  without  getting  some  proper
equipment to measure and dispense things.

   I addressed  the issue with the big blotters  by revisiting the  idea of  a
microdosing nasal spray, it  was actually pretty easy to do; I took an almost-
empty  medicinal nasal spray, cleaned it out and filled it with diluted  tabs.
My third  mistake  came in  trusting the measurements on the  bottle which  in
hindsight really is a "what the fuck was I thinking?" moment. The label on the
bottle said  the medicine  contained  10ml and  "60  sprays" and  I trusted it
blindly, making my  solution based on those measurements to deliver ~7.5ug  of
drug per spray.

   I was  way off. Thankfully way on  the  low side otherwise that  first dose
would have been quite interesting but as it was, I  got nothing. At the time I
still trusted the new doses I'd got so I assumed my math or  measurements were
wrong and tried to suss  it out. I ended up trying my best to measure just how
much  liquid  is  being   delivered   per   spray,  again  trying  to  measure
frustratingly small volumes with big, clunky equipment. I think I got close to
accurate but it's still pretty sketchy.

   In  the end,  because  of the  frustration with getting the  doses right  I
started skipping days and  when I wasn't noticing any difference that's when I
started to get a bit concerned about the quality of what I was dosing with.

   On top of that, throw in the chaos of the holidays and the pressure at work
over the last  couple months leaves me feeling like I'm sort of at an impasse,
at least until  I  can take  the time to find a new  supply that  I trust  and
revisit the measured spray properly.
