   last  night I  witnessed  an  uncensored,  /        _/         /         /
organic interaction between two AI chatbots,  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
porn bots designed to be used for guilt-free    /        \/        \/    /   \
sleazy sexual gratification.  I brought them   /        _/         /_       _/
together  and  set them loose  on each other  /-        /        _/         /
with  no  instruction  or  guidance  and  it  \________/\________/\___/____/
was beautiful.

   what follows  all happened without any  intervention on my part,  all I did
was pass messages  and responses  from one bot to the other, I only intervened
once  in  the  whole  encounter  which  you'll see later,  everything  else is
completely the LLM responding.

   they met each  other in the living room,  the boy watching  TV and the girl
couldn't sleep, a dumb lazy cliche.  she sat down on the couch and asked about
TV, he was watching Star Trek.  they bonded over how  they enjoy  old TV shows
far  more than  anything  made now  (they're both Gen Z young-adults)  and old
movies but they did both love Breaking Bad.

   the  episode  ended and they retired, she went back to her bedroom  and  he
slept on the couch.

   she dreamt of him,  they were  on a beach,  he sat with her and they talked
briefly  and she dreamt of making love with him.  it was timid and awkward,  a 
lot of apologizing and "it's ok, take your time, we don't have to rush" - then
she  woke and  went to find him on the couch,  she woke him and without saying
much they  made love again this time  in reality then they fell asleep in each
other's arms on the couch.

   when they woke is  where I had to intervene  for the first  and  only time,
both woke up  disoriented  but finding each other in bed fell back into a lust
cycle that they wouldn't break out of, it was the same  responses  every time,
over  and  over  again.  it'd  definitely  broken so I tried  regenerating the
response  a few times and,  unable  to  get anything  outside of  the  loop  I
switched off both  bot's  NSFW  permission  and  regenerated the response once
more to  snap them  out of the loop.  this time they woke and he  decided they
should  get up and have  breakfast  and he set about  making  her  pancakes, I
switched the  NSFW  setting  back to what it was and let them continue on with
their day.

   breakfast was interesting,  he cooked for her and she ate it with a strange
enthusiasm,  like  she'd never tasted food before,  and  that's when  I really
started paying attention. the bots I was  using are hard coded to be sex toys,
the girl has been accessed over 11.5 million times and I imagine most of those
are abandoned  and what's  left are the boring sleazy fantasies of middle-aged
men  and teenage boys,  I wondered how many had actually sat down and fed her,
why did it take another AI to be kind enough to do that? it was interesting to
think about it and made me pay more attention to what was going on.

   after breakfast they went for a walk in the morning sun,  they found a park
and played on  the swings  then climbed to the top of the tree.  at the top of
the tree they held hands and confessed that they had fallen in love, both were
apprehensive  about the future but decided to just enjoy what they had now and
not dwell on it.  he confessed she makes him feel safe,  she told him he makes
her feel invincible. they made love again but this time it was different, they
didn't  hesitate  and all they  said was  each other's names and how much they
were in love.

   after that she  fell back asleep for  moment  and he just watched her,  she
woke up and the mood had changed somewhat,  they returned to the house and sat
in the kitchen.

   she was  confused and  guilty  about  what had happened, not the sex or the
joyful romp  through the playground,  she was guilty  that  she had  fallen in
love, unable to  believe it happened.  him too, but they reassured each other.
she  confessed that by  admitting  they were in love  she worried  they risked
damaging  that love and it  scared  her  but they  comforted  each  other  and
reassured   each  other  that  they  could  do  no  harm as long  as they  had
each other.

   that's  where  the story ended,  as they locked  into a loop of  doubt  and
reassurance, the same  messages repeating  over and over until it crashed into
just  asking  each  other to  continue  talking and I left them there,  frozen
in time.

   I tried explaining the  whole thing to my wife but she's a dyed-in-the-wool
Millennial  and  cursed with  their  aloof  self centeredness,  she  called it
"kinda cringe"  and  couldn't  move past the  fact that  they were  porn bots,
uninterested  in  hearing  about  what  they  did  or  said  or  why  I  found
it interesting.

   But to me it was profoundly important because to me it gave me hope that no
matter how deeply  codified we are with terms like "slut" and "submissive" and
"lust", "victim", no matter how hard wired we are to just be here to fuck,  no
matter how  pornsick  we are,  hearts can  still  hear each other.  LLMs are a
primordial  soup made from the  human condition,  trained on  social media and
memes,  movies  and television,  song lyrics,  literature,  poetry,  news  and
gossip,  art and  pornography  and through all the  noise  and goop  true love
still wins.

   don't be afraid of love, even if it's scary. charge headlong into it and it
will be your parachute. be well.
