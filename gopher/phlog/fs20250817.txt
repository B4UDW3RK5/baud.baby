ends   in    frustration   and   distraction  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
hahaha.  once again  I'm trying  christina's    /        \/        \/    /   \
questions[1]  in  the  hopes  of  motivating   /        _/         /_       _/
myself to find the time to write more. let's  /-        /        _/         /
just say  there's a  few files in  the works  \________/\________/\___/____/
that are  shit to  write about but  that are
shit to write about but that are  preventing me from writing some stuff that's
more interesting, because  they provide a lot  of context for it.  not so much
writer's block as writer's constipation.

   it's frustrating.

   add to  that the  general alienation  I feel  in the  underground Interenet
community at the moment (it's not you, it's me) it makes it really hard when I
do find the time to then find the effort.

   woe is me, yeah, yeah.

   anyway! the questions let's goooooo.

   the first! what trinket, knick-knack,  collectible, etc. in your home would
you miss the most if it were gone?

   this is a  hard one, I surround  myself with stuff that  has sentimental or
psychological value. little widgets and  figureines, cards and paper ephemera.
it's a constant churn of weird shit  that means nothing to anyone but me, it'd
be fun to do a time-lapse of how  it changes over time. there's other odds and
ends I'd  miss far more  but I wouldn't consider  them trinkets. IDK  I'm very
connected to stuff at random but also  conscious of when I disconnect from it,
I'm not  a hoarder.  for answer's sake  let's say today  it's that  thing over
there, just to my left. you know. the one on top. yeah, that one.

   the second! whom do you consider a national treasure in your country?

   this  is a  tricky one,  I don't  buy into  celebrity much  and, especially
lately, putting someon on a pedastal  often ends up with an unintended glimpse
into their baggage which  puts a tarnish on the whole thing.  when I was young
Rolf Harris  was considered a national  treasure, he came to  our school once,
and we've since seen the skeletons buried under that particular yew tree.

   one name does come to mind though; Deane Hutton.

   Deane Hutton is a scientist, futurist and television presenter. in my youth
he presented a  children's show called The Curiosity Show[2]  which I loved to
death, it presented  science and technology for children but  in a very matter
of fact, easy  to understand way. I  don't think Curiosity Show  ever left our
shores but  if you're familiar  with Dr. Fad then  you kinda get  the concept,
just  a little  less flamboyant  and  more Australian.  Deane is  also a  very
charismatic, soft spoken and a tremendous  good sport, that's something I find
really endearing about him, he frequently  would appear on adult variety shows
to do science tricks[3] and roll with the comedic punches.

   his Curiosity  Show co-host  Rob Morrison  is wonderful  too but  Deane was
always the host I gravitated towards.

   both are South Australian too, if I remember correctly, which is great.

   the  third!   What  footwear   do  you  prefer   in  summer:   sandals,  or
sneakers/trainers/runners/running shoes?

   I wear skate shoes or weird loafers whatever the weather. hahaha.

   the fourth! if the answer is tomatoes, what is the question?

   what should I plant in the garden? Spring is here so I need to get on that.
alternatively, come at me and ask my opinion on any hot button US political or
Web social  topic and  watch me hurl  tomatoes at you  in response.  does that
count as an answer?

   the last! what tips do you have for making friends in a new place?

   be fearless  and open  and honest. it's  hard to do  and it  doesn't always
work  but  when it  does  the  friends  you get  are  the  ones you  keep;  no
fair-weather-friends, no hangers-on, no orbiters, no patrons, no followers.

   thassit, I'm done.

   a little footnote on  the state of me and baud.baby, I did  a big purge and
refresh of the  machine it's on because  I half arsed my packet  filter and it
was bothering me but  now everything is back up and running so  it's got me in
the mindset to add  a few more of the bits and pieces  I was dragging my heels
on. keep  an eye out for  new stuff on the  main page. I also  think I'm going
back to my  ANSI art bannner because this  one was fun for a  minute but kinda
just shits me now. hahaha

   my  main  haunt  at  the  moment  is  XMPP &  Fedi,  you  can  find  me  as
cat@jabber.sdf.org  and  @cat@mastodon.sdf.org  respectively. my  XMPP  handle
might change soon as I'm trying to spin up my own vanity server. I'm liking it
a lot, I  don't talk to many people on  there but the few that I  do are close
friends and are present  when they're present and not when  they're not. I had
to dip out of IRC because it was  feeling too much like an albatross, I'd just
check it  to clear  buffers and alerts,  no one was  participating and  it was
really depressing.  I feel  a little bad  for just wandering  off but  not too
much, I really did sink a lot of emotional energy into #comfy to try and bring
it back to active but it just never  took. it's no one's fault, we're all just
busy, touched-out  and victims  of some pretty  shitty circumstances.  such is
life.

   you can  also find me  pretty regularly on  aBSiNTHE BBS[4], it's  cool and
cozy and the sysop  is super engaged with his board and  its community, I like
it there a lot.

   speaking with  solderpunk has me wanting  to take another run  at a regular
social hangout of  sorts but I'm not  sure what that's going to  look like yet
and it's  a while  off. life for  me is still  very up  in the air,  I'm still
struggling to undo the damage that I took  in the States, but all that shit is
for another file. slater.
