   Jasper  was  a  skinny  white   cat  that   /        _/         /_       _/
belonged to my parents  before I was born, I  /-        /        _/         /
don't  remember  too  much about  him except  \________/\________/\___/____/
that I thought he was dangerous when I was a
kid. I assume he just didn't have time for some grabby kid invading his space.
One time he took  a real swipe at me because I  wanted to pat him or play with
him or something and he wasn't into it, he caught me right under my eye.  It's
probably the only  clear memory I  have of  him.  Later  he got quite sick and
passed before we moved to the desert.

   A couple moves later we adopted a beautiful tortoiseshell named Pepsi,  she
was really great. I remember her being super  vocal, she'd just  chatter on at
you while  you  were doing whatever and  I remember  her  having a purr like a
chainsaw motor. She was the  cat I grew up with. She loved to hang out with us
but also would disappear into the tall grass for days on her own. I'm not sure
what ever  happened to her, I moved out  of home  while she was  still around,
then my mom moved interstate and it gets muddy after that. She either left her
with a friend  while she organised  somewhere to live  and  she  ran away from
there or something else  happened and mom just didn't want to own up  to it. I
was heartbroken  when I found out, especially the story my  mom told. She  was
family,  you don't  fucking leave family  behind when  you  move.  Cats  don't
understand, to her she was just left  in a weird  place with  no idea what was
going on, of course she's going to bolt and she's  going to try  and  get home
and  there's going  to  be no  one there  for her.  How must that have felt? I
forgive  my mom a  lot  of  things, she's human and  has her own  stresses and
problems, but I'll never forgive that. Still upsets me to think about it, even
though it's an old wound.

   Later in  life, when I was really struggling I moved back in with my family
and at that time my  sister adopted a big white cat named Jarvis. He  was very
cheeky in  his youth.  At  the  time I was more-or-less  homeless, sleeping on
mom's sofa and at  night,  every night, as soon as  the lights went out Jarvis
would run up and down the top of the  sofa with  his claws out, making as much
noise as he  could. He'd  always  be fighting too,  or  just out in  the front
drive,  yelling into the night.  We still ended up pretty good pals though. He
mellowed out in his old age,  and mostly likes to just eat and chill out  now,
but  he's still occasionally getting into scuffles with other cats.  Remind me
to sneak him some treats next time I see him.

   Mana is my brother's partner's cat, she's black  and  white and  I'm pretty
sure she's had  her since before  they moved in together. I haven't spent that
much time  with her, just see  her  when we visit but  she seems really sweet.
Always comes up for a scratch. She's been put out somewhat by their young sons
but she seems to be doing ok.

   Smokey belonged to  my former housemate, she was small  and grey, hence the
name. She's got quite a  story. He  wanted  to  adopt a cat and  so went to  a
shelter for  a rescue and, as there always is, lots of lovely babies needing a
home. Smokey caught his eye but the staff were apprehensive. She had come from
a bad home and was very violent and unfriendly and difficult. He was set on it
though, she was the cat for him but while they were sorting everything  out, I
forget exactly what happened but she injured herself somehow, I  think she may
have thrown a tantrum when they tried to chip her or vax her or something. But
either  way,  he had to leave  her overnight and pick her  up  in  the morning
instead. Maybe  this was  them trying  to give him one last chance to back out
hahaha.

   Now let me tell you how violent they meant  when they said she was violent:
crazy fucking  violent. If she  was  a  dog  she  would  have  been  put  down
immediately, I'm not exaggerating. Thankfully she was a  tiny cat.  The normal
behaviour of an angry  cat is to yell and hiss at  you, maybe take a swipe and
then back off, because a  human is  exponentially  bigger than a cat and in  a
real fight they don't  stand a chance but when a cat  is  play-fighting with a
human they'll hold on and  bite  or kick a  bit  because they know it's  play-
fighting, even if they're a bit rough. Smoke would come at  you like  her life
was in mortal danger and escape wasn't  so much through you as much as  it was
buried inside you. She would  latch on and  cut you deep,  my  housemate would
play-fight with her and the scars on his wrists and arms made him look like he
self-harmed. I never got it that bad because she'd  mostly come around my room
to chill but she still got more than a few good blows in.

   I always found it interesting  that she  never hissed or growled or fluffed
up so she was never threatened or scared, it was just  play,  but  she  played
rough and  didn't intend to lose. Apart from that rough  streak she really was
very  cute  and sweet, when she came home she was scrawny and  had a messed up
nose from  stress and fighting and it was really a  pleasure  to have seen her
get happy and comfortable, my housemate really did good by her.

   Later we  went  separate ways and  he moved across  town,  there he adopted
another  cat named  Solomon, which is another interesting story. He was skinny
and dirty and my friend just started feeding him because he's a good guy, then
took him in. Solomon was the name he gave him. Got him desexed and chipped and
he got fat and happy. Later, his neighbors came by asking  for their cat back.
Apparently they'd  gone away  and just left him with some food in the  yard or
something like that? I forget the exact details but he more or  less told them
to go fuck themselves  and good on him. By the time I met him Solomon was very
round but also very handsome and he had the thickest  fur of any cat I've ever
seen. I remember him being pretty  gentle but my  friend assures me he can get
mean if you mess with his food.

   For the record; he did have to keep Solomon and Smoke separate for the most
part  because of  her  attitude but  they  managed. Later he  met  a girl  and
married, I think they have five cats between them now haha.

   Lastly  is Toby. Toby was my fiance's family's cat from well before we knew
each other and he was a long, slinky Siamese. He was very handsome. His health
got bad but I got to spend some time with him when we went to visit last year.
I apologised for taking his princess  from him and was glad I  got to see them
together. He passed away not long  after  that  visit but I'll always treasure
sitting with him, listening to birds in the lazy Washington morning sun.
