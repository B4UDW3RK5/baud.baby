   Sticker update: if you were in  the first six  responders then the stickers
were on the way. There were a couple of people who missed out but I'll hang on
to your details and send you out some when I resupply. I'm not gonna say who's
who hahaha.

   Thank you for your interest, everyone. Those packs went  really quickly and
requests came from all over the world, it's exciting.
