   a  while  back,  friends  and   I   would  /        _/         /         /
frequent  a  burger joint buried in the guts  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
of   Southbank's  Casino  and  entertainment    /        \/        \/    /   \
district   called   The    Merrywell.    The   /        _/         /_       _/
Merrywell,  being  adjacent  to  the  Casino  /-        /        _/         /
meant  they were open for  Christmas,  so it  \________/\________/\___/____/
became a spot I could rely on to drag people
to or that people  could reliably drag me to on my birthday.  it wasn't really
much to speak of,  another  fancy  burger  place in a  city  filled with fancy
burger places,  but what kept us coming back was a cocktail they  had in their
arsenal called Sucker Punch.

   and it lived up to it's name; it's deceptively easy to drink, and if you're
not  carefeul  on a hot  Melbourne  afternoon it will  quickly  knock  you  on
your ass.

   I think The Merrywell is gone now but  I've had this copycat recipe kicking
around for a while,  the Web blog it was posted to is decaying so I'm going to
share it here in Gopherspace in the hopes it lives on.

   to make  Sucker Punch  you mix one shot of a citrus flavored vodka,  half a
shot of  elderflower liquer,  three shots of a  sour  green apple  juice and a
splash of lemon juice.  put it in a shaker with some  fresh  mint and ice  and
shake  it  up then  dump  it  into  your  punch  bowl  and  top it up  with  a
nice Champagne.

   by luck,  I checked through the  phlogroll  before closing this one off and
as it happens,  christyotwisty has also shared a festive drink recipe[1],  you
should check it out.
