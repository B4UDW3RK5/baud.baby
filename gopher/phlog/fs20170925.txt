   2017-09-18 (Day 7)

   So  after dwelling  on  Friday's dose  I decided to reduce  how  much I was
taking, it really wasn't effective, the afternoon was good but the morning was
a write-off. It felt fun but I couldn't get anything done. Today I cut one  of
the doses in  half  so it  should  be somewhere  around  10ug. I can  feel  it
pressing in on  the sides but the  fog is nowhere near as thick  as it  was on
Friday. Stay tuned, sports fans.

   I genuinely miss the taste of energy drinks in the morning.


   2017-09-19 (Day 8)

   Headache today, only mild but  still, I thought  I was past this. Yesterday
was really good.  I  didn't feel wired or online, it just  felt like  a pretty
good day. Running out of things to write here, I feel like the whole thing has
kind of fizzled out, last week was  rough and this week has been pretty boring
so far.

   Even on days when I don't dose I have a bounce in my  step and I'm noticing
I'm far more upbeat than normally. Whether that is the effect of drug  or just
the effect of me having a cheeky secret, I couldn't say.


   2017-09-20 (Day 9)

   Yesterday was a good day,  stressful  but  I handled  it.  Other people are
starting  to notice a  real shift in my mood and attitude, Danielle noted that
I'm  a lot  happier  after  work and  that I seem to  be finding  it easier to
disconnect from work at the end of the day, rather than carrying it around and
stressing about it.

   Today  is going  to  be full  on, the  timeline for the  project I'm on got
brought  forward so I have two days to complete the build. It's a dose day but
I also had an energy  drink.  I'm finding that the dosing does  wonders for my
mood,  attitude and interpersonal skills but it's not delivering  on making me
feel  more engaged with my work,  I am getting  stuff done but at  a  plodding
pace, I'm missing that ferocity that you get from caffeine.

   Drinks  with friends on Friday probably, I haven't seen them  in a while so
it'll be interesting to see if they notice any difference.

   I read an  account earlier of  a microdoser using  diluted LSD  in a  nasal
spray (hayfever season, got me  thinking) and that just sounds like genius, so
much smarter than  chasing  a tiny piece of paper around your mouth so I might
try that down the line. I'd need  to source liquid LSD though so. Since I'm on
10ug for the time  being I have enough from what I bought to  probably last me
another month or so, this stuff goes a long way.


   2017-09-21 (Day 10)

   Yesterday  was  alright,  work has been  high-stress lately but I'm staying
above it.  Can't really say whether  that's the drug or I'm  taking stuff  in-
stride. Reading  posts by other people who have done this is starting to get a
bit disheartening, they speak of all these miraculous changes and euphoria and
magic but I'm  over here like,  ok this is better but barely. Maybe  I need to
try  a different type of LSD?  Tomorrow  I'll dose around  15ug  and  see what
shakes loose.


   2017-09-22 (Day 11)

   This is it, my droogs. I think I found my groove at ~15ug. I feel cheerful,
I feel engaged, I can concentrate, only a little light-headed.

   Frustratingly all my measures  are a best guess since it relies  on the LSD
being evenly distributed on the blotter which is probably not really true. I'm
going to pull the trigger on the 60ug blotters tonight. Less  division means I
can have more faith in the amount, right now I'm fussing with  pieces as small
as  1/20th of  the  blotter and it's just  getting silly. A properly mic'd out
liquid would be so much  more accurate but the smallest amount I could find in
a quick search was 100 doses of 150ug for $750, at my current consumption it'd
last me,  what? Like six and a half years? It'd be a pretty good investment if
I was certain I was going  to continue this for that long but  I suppose right
now it's a moot point anyway because I don't have $750 to blow on fucking acid
hahaha.

   I'll also admit that now that I'm getting a feel for it  I'm curious to see
if  other formulas  will have different results,  the drug I'm  using  now  is
called VoidRealm, the one  in the 60ug  blotters  is called Parvati's Tears. I
think they're named for the design  on the blotter? I dunno.  Don't  listen to
me, I don't know shit.

   Anyway, so I'll check  back in  at the end of the day with any insight then
tidy all this up to post it on FAX SEX and that'll be that.

   Update: It's like 13:30  and I am just  having the best day, wow. Spring in
my step, head clear, feeling way on top of shit. I might leave this file  open
for a summary on Monday and see  if Monday at  the same  dose feels  the same.
That rounds it  out at two weeks proper, since my first  dose day fizzled  out
when I was still waiting on the drug.


   2017-09-25 (Day 14)

   I  feel  really good, like  really,  really good. No headache, no stress. I
feel like I'm doing so much better at taking shit in-stride instead of getting
angry  at things that don't  matter. Even  between doses I'm  noticing  really
great  results and the people around me are noticing too. We had anime club on
the weekend and it was just  as dumb and awkward as  the last meeting but this
time I ENJOYED it being dumb and awkward. I just had a really good time.

   I'm going to have a shadow at work today so let me nail this down quick.

   It's the last day I'll keep this running log for, any exciting developments
after  this I'll  just put in  a  regular phlog post  or  crow  about  on  the
fediverse.

   Let's answer  the  big questions but,  keep in mind that  this is  entirely
subjective, no two people have the same brain and all I can base this on is my
specific experience.

   Was it  worth trying? Absolutely.  This kind of wetware  hacking is  a trip
(pun  intended)  and pretty safe, LSD  is not  physically addictive so  if you
aren't feeling it then stopping will be  pretty painless and if you're worried
about accidentally miss-dosing there's other drugs you can get to keep on hand
that will ease  you through  or abort a trip. The only  other thing I'd really
recommend if  you do try is to make sure someone you trust  knows what  you're
doing. Don't go it alone, make sure you  have someone to  talk  to  about  how
you're  feeling  and what  you're  feeling and  someone  to  gauge  how you're
behaving.

   Is there anything I  would have done differently? There's a few things I've
mentioned already  in  the  phlog posts; blotters with smaller doses, starting
with a smaller microdose. The  only other thing I would do different, and this
is pretty specific to my  situation, is  winding down the caffeine and codeine
intake rather than going cold turkey. That week was a shit and could have been
avoided if I wasn't so impatient.

   Am I going  to continue? No  doubt. With  ~15ug I feel  like I've found  my
groove  I'm  going to carry  on with that. I might set myself a reminder for a
couple months' time to reflect  on  how  it's  going but  for the  foreseeable
future I'm going to keep it up.

   I hope  this  has been interesting to read. To be  fair, like  most  of the
phlog, it's as much for me as it is for the reader but I hope for someone it's
started some gears turning.
