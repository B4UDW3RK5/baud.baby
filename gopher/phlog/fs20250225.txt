   you can find the audio files in Gopherspace[1] or, if you like, I also made
it available on Bandcamp[2]. sometime this year I'll have a physical tape
release ready.

   I recycled the LOWWIRE name from my brief stint on aNONradio, it was fun to
work on an audio project again.

   my poetry won't be remembered or widely celebrated, I'm an amateur at best,
cringeworthy at worst,  but I'm tremendously proud of it because it comes from
a place of peace,  when my head and heart align, so it made me really happy to
be able to capture it.
