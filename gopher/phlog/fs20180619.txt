   This past Saturday marks one year since I  /        _/         /         /
started  this Gopher  space  so  I  figure I  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
should  write  something,  even if  I  don't    /        \/        \/    /   \
really    have     anything     particularly   /        _/         /_       _/
interesting to  say.  I just  haven't really  /-        /        _/         /
felt like  writing  lately, but it's  slowly  \________/\________/\___/____/
coming  back  to  me.  I  did  do  a  little
housekeeping though,  and  turned off  my  mokupona  instance, I wasn't really
using it so it was  just wasted  resources  and I was  getting irritated at it
always bumping me to the top of the gopher.club list.

   I'm back from the States now and  life  stumbles on. It was a good and  bad
trip, I really struggled  with my place in things while I was there. It's hard
to summarise, I probably need to sit down  and get it all  on  paper but  like
most mental health junk, when it's good you don't want to deal with how it was
when it was bad. Aside from that, work still sucks but I'm about ready to burn
some bridges so we'll see how that works out haha.

   Anyway: Happy 31st to the SDF, thanks for  all the  stuff you do, thanks to
smj for keeping the fortress flying and  thanks to the community  that make it
the nicest place to live online.

   I've got a lot of posts to catch up on and I'll get back at y'all soon.
