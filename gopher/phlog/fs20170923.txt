   2017-09-04 (Day -7)

   I'm writing this in parallel with  my usual phlog posts and will compile it
into one  file so  apologies if  it  gets  lengthy.  I've  been  reading about
microdosing psychedelics for  a few months, it's fascinating  and  anecdotally
the results seem to be really encouraging so, in line with my goal  to make my
year more cyberpunk and my  self-consciousness lately about having  no follow-
through on anything I've decided to give it a shot.

   To  get a better idea  of the efficacy  of microdosing though, I'm going to
have  to give up anything I already do and starting today I've gone clean from
the bits and pieces I was using to get me through  my  day-to-day for the last
however  many years. This  was mostly a combination of  caffeine and  codeine,
plus whatever collateral shit came with them (eg. the taurine in energy drinks
and ibuprofen  or  paracetamol  in the pills). A big ol'  energy  drink and  a
couple  pills  in  the morning. Body gets soft, brain spins up and I'm online.
I've  also cut  out  the alcohol I'd use to disconnect  at the end of the day,
just so I'm a reasonably blank slate.

   Let me tell ya,  it's only the  first morning  of a  week of this  and  I'm
already hating it.


   2017-09-05 (Day -6)

   Today seems  easier  than  yesterday,  although I've  already  cheated  and
allowed myself  a Coke.  Yesterday  I had a bad allergy day so  it was like  a
double-whammy of feeling rubbish but today that's gone away.

   The  doses of what  I was taking  previously weren't very high and although
they fluctuated a bit they  never escalated.  I don't really have an addictive
personality, I just find my groove and off  I go forever, I rarely felt like I
needed  to speed up or  switch gears. I remember a guy I used to work with who
was hardcore, if I remember correctly he was in  an accident and messed up his
legs  real  bad and  got hooked  on opioids  from  there.  Some days he'd just
disappear into his office  and take pills until he was nodding.  I heard later
my boss let him go because he was completely useless every day, he said it was
like working with a  zombie. A real shame since he was really, really outside-
the-box smart.


   2017-09-06 (Day -5)

   Struggle city. Caffeine withdrawal has my head feeling like it's in a clamp
and the  lack  of  codeine is just, like, I dunno. It's just  like  everything
seems  wrong, like  the edges  are  too sharp?  It's hard  to explain  without
sounding silly, it's not like I'm a hardcore junkie gone clean so  I feel like
I'm exaggerating all the time. Short story; I don't  like it. Everything feels
too difficult and I'm not having fun.

   I did the deed  last night and picked up the LSD from a dark web  market. I
thought  it'd be more  difficult  than  it  was  and  I thought  I'd feel more
SUPAL33T doing  it hahaha.  Turns out  it's just  like  buying  from any other
online  marketplace. It's  "99%+  pure Aztec crystal" whatever that means? I'm
sure it means about as much as a snack  being 99% fat free. I also  got a test
kit just to be sure  but to be honest, something about the vendors  just seems
really  legit. Just guys looking to make some dough, not looking for  trouble.
You  see  some  that  are obviously  sketchy  but you  get that on  any  other
marketplace  too, Craigslist or eBay  or whatever. We'll see if my opinion  on
that changes in a few days, I suppose.


   2017-09-07 (Day -4)

   Package shipped yesterday  and  should arrive today or tomorrow. I've never
really had much motivation  to experiment with drugs, they always seemed scary
when I was a kid and I guess when I was a  teenager that fear, combined with a
general defensiveness brought  on by not understanding what was  going on with
my mental  health transitioned into a kind of high-and-mighty "drugs are dumb"
attitude.  Friends would bring  them up  and I'd get  snotty  about  it. I did
somehow end up smoking for a while as a teenager but I guess that was about as
rebellious as I got.

   I don't  remember when/how  I feel  into  pain  killers,  I get  pretty bad
migraines so I'm sure it was related to that. Something about them coming from
a pharmacy shorted out that fear/attitude  and they  were so easy to get  back
then.  Beyond  that  I  haven't done much;  I'd  substitute  the  codeine  for
oxycodone when I  could do  so without too  much hassle or expense  (ie.  very
rarely), I smoke weed  maybe  once  a year and I've  taken LSD once before but
asked my friend specifically for a small dose because I was doing it alone and
didn't want to stress out, I dunno how strong it was but the effect was pretty
mild.

   On the going-clean side of things, I've been cheating a bit and  had  a few
Cokes, not much caffeine in them but some caffeine is  more than none caffeine
and caffeine withdrawal is the  absolute worst shit. My jaw  hurts  a bit from
tension but aside from that I'm feeling pretty ok.


   2017-09-08 (Day -3)

   On the  wetware  front, yesterday  wasn't that bad. The pain  in my jaw has
gone and the caffeine withdrawal headache is down to a dull pressure, although
that feels worse today than it did yesterday.

   Was expecting  ~the goods~ to arrive yesterday and  they didn't  but that's
cool, they should come today.  If they  don't I guess I'll just  truck through
Monday as  I'm  doing  now and  start dosing  from  Wednesday. I've read a few
anecdotes  with different  schedules;  one  guy dosed  daily, resting  on  the
weekend   and  Fadiman's   study  was   dosing   Sunday  and  Wednesday   with
rest/observation days in between.  I'm going  to meet somewhere in the middle,
dosing Monday, Wednesday  and Friday and  resting between,  about  20ug of LSD
each dose.

   I'm  so  naive about  this stuff that  I'm searching all this beginner shit
online; can I do this, how long does it take for that, is it safe to whatever,
and for some reason it reminded me of a letter in Nintendo Power:

      "Do your Nintendo tapes only last  five years? Does it  matter if you
      set them on chairs or if you put the controllers on the floor?"

   Hahahaha, does it matter if you set a tab of acid on a chair I wonder?

   I guess before  I close out this cleansing week I should summarise what I'm
doing, what it promises on the box and what I hope to get out of it?

   Psychedelic microdosing is  the act of  taking regular sub-perceptual doses
of  psychedelic drugs, for example  ~10-20ug of  LSD to  improve productivity,
enhance creativity, focus and  relational  skills. Although reports have  been
mostly anecdotal,  subjects have noticed  increased creative output, increased
physical energy and stamina, improved emotional  balance, being  more sociable
and a reduction in stress, depression and anxiety.

   What  I want  out  of  this whole  thing is more  consistent  productivity,
caffeine is  wonderful but for me it feels like a spike. I  make magic  in the
morning  but by  the afternoon  it  all wears off  and  I run  out  of  steam.
Additionally I want something to replace the dependency I have on pain killers
to "get  me  through the  day", particularly  since they  make  me spacey  and
withdrawn which at work is not ideal. I'm already  noticing a slight shift  in
that this week  since going  clean but at the  cost of feeling comfortable and
calm around  people,  it'd be nice to see that  improved  sociability  and the
reduction in depression/anxiety mentioned in the write ups and reports.

   I'm a little worried that it'll be too much and I'll get wobbly or weird at
work  and  have to head home but my main concern, though still not  such a big
deal, is that it just does nothing. Even then, I'm only out  some cash for the
drugs and tester  and  I roll back  to  codeine and  caffeine and have  a  few
really, really good days after these weeks spent drying out. I was also joking
with Danielle that if this doesn't work out we have an anime convention coming
up at the end of the first week,  so  we can just dose the  rest before going.
Now THAT will be something to post about ahahahahaha.

   Ultimately, whether it  works or not the act of doing is still an  exciting
thing. The more I  read about LSD the  more  I feel aware of a magic aura that
surrounds it and the more I understand it the more I love the idea of it. It's
a bright, iridescent opal of a thing, simultaneously primitive and futuristic,
party  drug  and  entheogen,  an immeasurable infinity  contained  in  a  tiny
chemical droplet.

   I likely won't update this log over the weekend so the next entry you  read
will be into my first dose. Stay tuned, deckers.
