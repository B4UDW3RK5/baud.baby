I'd take a  moment  to sneak a peek into his
world and phlog a journal of his day, let's see how it pans out.

   "I'm awake.  I dreamt I was surrounded by  strong boned men saluting me, it
made me proud. I hate to have woken from it.

   I pulled on my hair shirt and set about my day,  making a breakfast of egg,
I prefer to swallow the thing whole so I don't have to cook or taste it.

   First on my  agenda is to  confirm  other humans exist.  I look for  IanJ's
server, it is still running this means he is still alive and thinking. Good.

   I check for  updates on other  servers  using the  Gopher  protocol they're
talking  about  their  lives.  Children.  I  grind  my teeth as  I read  about
someone's  garden.  My  ears ring with  tension  when I see that  someone  has
written about their holiday.  I increase my font size so the words slam across
my vision. These awful creatures.

   The one d egenerate  named cat has written a post but I can't  read it. His
Gopher map is not RFC  compliant.  I hate it.  It shouldn't  exist.  My vision
turns red.

   I tire of my computer  and the horrible things  it shows  me so I leave the
house to consume some stimulants. I strap my sandals on too tight, my toes are
crowded, I hate it.

   I walk to the  Starbucks.  Why  does  the sign  have to be green.  The sign
shouldn't be green.  It stinks in here. Like coffee and fresh air.  People are
laughing.  It's obscene.  I drive my  fingernails  into the palm of my hand to
escape the violence of their stupid vacant lives.

   I order a coffee. Black coffee in a cup.  The coffee is hot so I pour it in
my lap. The idiot staff, thinking I've spilled it, ask if I need help. I unzip
my pants and let them drop to my ankles.

   Erect and scalded red from the hot coffee  I waddle home knowing I'm better
than these broken people.

   Fuck them.

   It was my birthday, no one mentioned it.

   Assholes."

   sux to be you, homie. calm down or you'll have a stroke.
