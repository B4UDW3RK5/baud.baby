PHONEBOOKS. let's go...                       \________/\________/\___/____/

   1. Has a self-help book ever helped  you? If yes, would you share the title
and author?

   I'll be honest, I've  never even read one haha. I  don't find help helpful,
if that  makes sense, I  prefer to muddle through  and do research,  trial and
error, even in day  to day things. I do have fond memories  of self help gurus
on late  night infomercials though, Tony  Robbins, The Secret and  the like. I
sometimes wonder where these people are now.

   2. How many times  a month do you cook dinner at home?  Do you plan most of
your meals, or do you start by  looking in the refrigerator to see what hasn't
gone bad?

   almost  always! we're  dirt poor  and takeout  in Australia  can be  pretty
expensive. it was expensive in the States  too but my wife's family loves junk
food and hates effort  so we did eat out a lot there,  we cooked our own meals
maybe two or three  times a week. we used to meal plan  but now we mostly play
it by ear, we  have a pretty solid rotation of favorites and  we live near the
stores we  need so  we can  pick things up  for meals  easily. our  fridge and
pantry are reasonably  stocked but mostly with spices,  condiments, and basics
like flour, baking soda, etc.

   3. Where do you get your recipes  for #2? If you have multiple cookbooks do
you rotate them?

   most of  our recipes are  an accumulation of here  and there; some  we were
taught by family, some we found online, some we just kinda made up as we went.
almost  all of  our  recipes are  very simple  though,  we're not  complicated
people.

   4. If you've gone  antiquing or thrift store shopping, what  is one of your
great finds?

   I LOVE antiquing and thrifting and it's one of the only things I miss about
living in  the United States,  I found some  incredible things over  there; an
illuminated  mensroom sign,  a couple  wonderful old  telephones, a  beautiful
rabbit painting or two, the perfect baseball  bat (now sadly gone) and I could
go on.

   in Australia it's fun too but we have nowhere near the incredible volume of
second hand stuff the  United States does. that said though  I have found some
gems,  probably  my  favorite find  was  a  very  tidy  first edition  of  the
illustrated Watership Down, complete with slip case. it's gorgeous.

   5. What would make, or has made, you more patriotic?

   for this  one I've got  nothin, patriotism is not  really my style.  I'm an
anarchist to my core, I live in  Australia but I don't represent Australia and
Australia does not represent me. there are certainly things Australia could do
to  make  me proud  to  live  here though,  but  they're  unlikely to  happen;
abandoning war  and hostility,  abandoning a  monetary economy  in favor  of a
resource economy,  evicting the toxic  capitalist cancers that  keep Australia
under their thumb.

   those things all sound very extreme but it would take an extreme change for
me to be proud enough of our country to stand up and say "I am Australian."
