   There's this kind of feeling you get when  /        _/         /         /
you  see someone you  know but don't  really  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_

   Year before last, I think, I  was on a tram in  Melbourne and I saw a woman
and I just knew. I  knew I knew her and I  knew I knew who she  was, it was so
strange. I didn't say anything but watched her out of the corner of my eye.

   The most interesting part  was there was a kind of  recognition in her body
language too, as though she knew she knew me.

   I think back on that moment a lot.

   A kind of short-lived, silent, psychic reunion of two old friends.
