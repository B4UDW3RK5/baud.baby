   I  hecked up!  I said that my  next  file  /        _/         /         /
wouldn't be about drugs and it was, at least  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
in part. My bad hahaha.  Let me try and keep    /        \/        \/    /   \
the ball rolling then.                         /        _/         /_       _/

   I'm not doing  anything interesting  with  \________/\________/\___/____/
my life really, trundling along on autopilot
for a while, too scattered for big stuff and too lazy for small stuff.

   Other people, however, are doing lots of interesting stuff.

   A quick aside before  we get started; I just wanted to reach out to  Kvothe
should he still  be around gopherspace; I'm sad to see you go, your phlog will
definitely be missed but I hope all is well. <3

   I  wanted  to  call  out  the  Project  Gemini[1] stuff.  Now I'm still not
convinced of the  need  for it, but that's my  personal  opinion  and  doesn't
diminish how much work they're putting into it and it's a fascinating project.
A lot of  people come in to this space trying to "fix" or reinvent Gopher  but
almost none put shoulder to wheel  and  build  something, let alone  something
from the ground up.

   It's fascinating to see it coming together.

   Continuing  around the grounds, fosslinux did an excellent phlog post[2] on
picking apart and bypassing his school proxy, pretty cool!

   The  two below  are as much  for my memory as  your  enjoyment, so I  don't
forget to circle back on them later:

      - tomasino  has started a zine![3] Submissions are due  by the end of
        August so  get on it. The keyword is "HAMMER"  and I have  a couple
        ideas, stay tuned.

      - solene  wrote on  streaming  to  Twitch from BSD[4]  and  I've been
        trying  to get some  kind of  Twitch presence going.  Currently I'm
        doing it from my  Mac but I  have a second  laptop that I'd like to
        use instead, this guide should help a lot.

   Phew,  that's a lot,  but one last thing I wanted to highlight for y'all is
the  baffling  but  surprisingly engaging new "stoned  phlogs"  popping up  on
tilde.black.  brool[5]  is  a   cryptic,  rambling  stream   of  consciousness
phlog/ASCII art doodle pad while smore[6] is an extensive, fascinating list of
half-formed ideas and concepts.

   ~black is growing into  a pretty interesting place, I'm curious to see what
else comes of it.

   That's  only  the tip of the iceberg, seems like there's a lot  going on in
the phlogosphere lately, so much to read, get to it!
