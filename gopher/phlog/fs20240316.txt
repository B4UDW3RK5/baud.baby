   We both  collect  simple  parts  into  magnificent,  powerful machines.  We
breathe life into metal and tend to it.

   I lost my friend to cancer and it's unfair that life carries on without him
but the inheritance  he left me will see me through.  I asked for  nothing but
what he left me is valuable  beyond  measure; a strong,  kind,  proud wife,  a
network of people he called friend that now call  me friend in kind and a mind
to carry on his work.

   I'll miss you  Mike but in the  moments I need  you I'll  know you're still
there for me in those gifts you left behind.
