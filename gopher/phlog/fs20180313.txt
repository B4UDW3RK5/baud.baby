   Procedurally    generated    drone    was
something I fooled around with a little bit a while back, that resulted in the
K6MWT recordings[2] -  I wish  I could remember  what tool I used for that but
it's been some time, I'll have to have a dig through my notes when I'm back in
front of my laptop.

   I missed a whole bunch  of  topics  that  rippled through the phlogosphere,
perpetually late to the  party,  but one I  did  want to touch on because it's
near and dear to  me  was the  discussion around what  makes gopher special to
you, kicked off by ckeen[3].

   I did  kind  of  touch on this in my very first  post[4] and those comments
pretty much still hold true. A lot of people seem  to  find the  simplicity of
the protocol a  draw but for  me,  the appeal of gopher is  in how  it  really
recaptures that feeling of family  from  the late BBS/early internet era, that
glorious period  when the  online  experience  was driven  by  enthusiasts and
community and not advertising-fed superficiality. It's an era I miss terribly.
Like  that BBS era, everyone in a gopher  space seems to know, or at the  very
least is only a few degrees of separated from everyone else and although we're
spread out all over the world each gopher  space feels "local",  when I browse
the network of spaces and gopher holes I feel like I'm  visiting my neighbors,
when I browse the wider Web I feel  like I'm visiting the duty free mall at an
airport.

   Grandmaster  Ratte'  of  the  cDc once said that the modern Web "feels more
one-sided,  like  somebody  put   [it]  together  to  serve  to  you,"  and  I
wholeheartedly agree, even in wake of the rise of  social media  the community
comes second to  the content,  even though supposedly the "community" are  the
content creators. The  activity springing  up around gopher really feels  like
the antithesis to that, a return to community and community-inspired content.

   So what else has been happening with me?

   I blew away  my  existing gopher space and rebuilt most of  it,  as you may
have noticed. Kind of a little proud of it haha. Aside from  that life carries
on with its usual ups and downs, I'm probably long  overdue for a life update,
I might try and tackle that separately rather than cram it in the end here.

   Stay tuned for that, sports fans.

   Oh  and  I'm  back  on Mastodon  again I guess? Have I really  not phlogged
properly since then? Hahahaha.
