   Lost my  groove there one  second, Dani's
movie grossed me out,  she watches shit that's  too heavy for me, I just wanna
watch garbage.

   Anyway so  where have I been, shit, I  don't even know  where to start. I'm
sitting on about a dozen unfinished phlog files that maybe I'll try and get to
soon but some of them are replies to things that are basically ancient now, in
Gopher time. I dunno, I still have some relevant shit to say.

   Life's  a  constant stressor but that  ain't news. I've traveled  a bit but
I'll write about that in a second file.

   My TildeRadio show languishes, I  missed two  shows  because they  fell  on
either side of travel and life was too hectic to organize something to play in
my absence. I'm kind of  at  a crossroads with live streaming stuff,  I  still
have fun  but when I'm not having fun it's really, really,  not  fun. I assign
too much significance to this shit and feel disproportionately frustrated when
it doesn't go well.  Compound  that  with the usual anxiety  nonsense and some
days I just want to shelve it and do something else you know?

   I'm closing in on one year since  I started on TildeRadio and I think if my
head hasn't  settled on  it  by  then  it might  be time  to drop the  regular
timeslot and just stream whenever I feel like.  We'll see, we'll see. I've had
thoughts on a  couple other things I'd like to do for it but they're less live
and more  pre-scheduled so maybe  if I do bow out  of  the live  shindig I can
still provide regular content in some way.

   We'll have to see.

   What else do I have going on?

   I'm kinda dipping my toe back into the nerd phone game, I fell out  of love
for a bit when life attacked and had trouble spinning back into it but now the
weather  is  warming up and I'm  less  cranky  and  feeling  more  creative so
hopefully I can maintain momentum. I've got a LOT of things left unfinished in
that space too and a couple new ideas. Again, though, we'll have to see.

   I think  that's where I'm at, will  try and  get back  to you sooner rather
than later. Cat out.
