   So "project month"  kinda fizzled out for  /        _/         /         / 
me  but that's  ok,  TDK  keeps me busy  and  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
that's  fine,  she's gotta  be my  priority.    /        \/        \/    /   \
                                               /        _/         /_       _/
   One of the projects I wanted to launch is  /-        /        _/         /
an   anonymous   plain-text   ezine   called  \________/\________/\___/____/
23_embryo;   users  can  submit  just  about
anything,  the  idea  is  it's  a place  for  deep/unusual  thoughts  or  just
stuff you feel like doesn't  fit your phlog or just to post one-shot things if
you don't have an ongoing phlog or whatever.

   The one  caveat  is I  have final editorial  say on  everything  that  gets
published, I won't publish anything racist, *phobic, overly sexually explicity
or that's targets someone else.

   This project actually started as a stoned.txt[1] but the idea kinda fizzled
out because  I no longer  really have any time to smoke,  even before  TDK was
born so that project  is dead but I didn't want to waste  the effort  put into
layout so 23_embryo[2] was born.

   The basic idea is I collect articles from whoever  wants to submit them and
when I reach 23 I compile them publish an issue.

   Currently submissions  can be submitted to my SDF email address cat@sdf.org
and your anonymity is my absolute  assurance.  I'm not sure where I'll publish
the final zine  but for now it'll likely  just be here on  baud.baby.  I don't
think I'll use the tilde.club u ser and I'll just  ask for  that to be removed
when I publish the first issue.

   Stay tuned for that and watch  out for a few more project  announcements in
the next few days!
