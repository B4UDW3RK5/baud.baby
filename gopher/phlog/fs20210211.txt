   I've  wanted to  do a voicemail dead-drop  /        _/         /         /
ages ago  but I  couldn't nail  down  what I  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
wanted to do it for. More recently I've been    /        \/        \/    /   \
going  through  and  trying  to organize  my   /        _/         /_       _/
phone  stuff  and  found  my  old  answering  /-        /        _/         /
machine tape so I backed it up to an mp3 and  \________/\________/\___/____/
gave it  a listen and it  was  great, a real
nostalgia hit. That reminded  me of the dead drops and I had this idea to make
a collection of voicemails on here.

   But first:

   Please use your common sense  if you call the  line. The recordings will be
posted here for anyone to listen to and might be used in future  projects. Try
to remember that if  you're revealing personal info or incriminating  shit but
ultimately that's on  you. I can take down a  voicemail if you contact me (you
know where I'm at or you know someone who knows) about it but like all things
on the Internet; once it's out there it's always out there.

   The only identification I'll use is the filename, which I think may be just
a timestamp, so you can reveal as much  or as little as you like about who you
are.

   That out of the way, let's go. Call the number below, leave a voicemail and
wait for it to  appear here. That last step I'm still  working on so it may be
slow while I'm trying out things and troubleshooting.

   +1 (929) 601-BAUD.

   Here is a fun ad should you want to throw it in one of your phlog files for
a laugh. I appreciate the exposure.
