changes I've made is to the formatting, some   /        _/         /_       _/
punctuation here  and  there for readability  /-        /        _/         /

back then I obnoxiously wrote  everything in
lowercase. I apologise in advance for  my use  of the words  "craptacular" and
"jawsome", the excessive ellipsis and emoticons.

   Anyway, enjoy this stupid time capsule.


   2002-07-23

   Let  me just  start by saying AVCon  was a  total riot. It was the best fun
I've  had in  ages. It started off a little shitty because I  woke up late and
missed the Ranma screening which I  didn't mind  too much but  then it clicked
that  it's Saturday and because  there are  hardly any busses  on Saturday I'd
miss the  Card  Captor  Sakura movie also.  After  that there was  no big rush
because the next thing I wanted to see  was Cowboy Bebop and that wasn't until
like 2:30 or somesuch. When  we turned up they were showing Aa  Megami-sama...
dubbed (bleargh)  but that was ok because I didn't want  to see it  anyway. We
registered and had a quick  look around when went and  got lunch  and some Red
Bull (yay). My day just kept getting better after that.

   The games  bit wasn't really interesting but  that's not  what I  was there
for. They  had a NES  set up though which was neat. The traders room was about
what I  expected... just Movie Maniacs and  Shin  Tokyo. Would have  been nice
except everything seemed to be the same prices  as they had in store so it was
pretty much an "I don't need  to get any of this now" type situation... didn't
stop me getting a Dejiko UFO doll... I mean I had to get a souvenir, didn't I?
;)

   I was really impressed by the cosplay, made me wish I'd made an effort like
I was originally going to instead of just thinking "Blah, it's Adelaide, there
won't be any  good cosplayers".  But then  I've  always said how there  is  no
middle ground in Adelaide; something is either amazing  or it's craptacular. I
really should start listening to myself. There  was some jawsome Wolfwoods and
an amazing guy-from-Final-Fantasy-Ten (I  don't  remember his name... Tidus? I
don't know  much  about Final  Fantasy beyond Seven, but that's a  whole other
kettle of fish). There was also a very distracting plug-suit Asuka who's image
has  more or less burned onto  my retinas ehehheh (STFU  Cat). Must have taken
some guts to wear that in public.

   Cowboy  Bebop  was pretty much  the  same as it's  always been  except on a
bigger screen  and in the wrong order (for whatever reason), still worth going
for though.

   After an ep and a half of Cowboy Bebop I got bored and needed more caffeine
so I went to check out the other things that were happening elsewhere (ie. The
misc programming/AMV  comp whatsit). I think we (I... We... Whatever) wandered
into the Unibar (I could type *clang!* here but I won't)  just as the AMV comp
was sorta-starting. AMV's aren't something I've ever really paid  attention to
so I don't know if the ones I  saw were good in comparison to the  whole scale
of things but the ones I saw there were pretty jawsome. There was one that was
corrupted or  something (they were  playing  from PC) and so the  comp had  to
stop. LAINstation. I can remember  the title  now that I don't  need  too, but
when I had to all I could come up with was "That Lain one with that industrial
band"...  Although "That Lain one with that  industrial band" still  won  me a
snickers at the  quiz  night. :D I'd never even heared of  the band before but
the MC said something about it being an industrial band. I  guess I'm slipping
in my old age.

   After the AMV thingy crapped out I don't remember what I did until Shamanic
Princess. Then I watched shamanic princess. It was good but  not as good as  I
remember  it being. Still good though. I love  when she poses  infront  of the
moon it's cheesy but in a good way. ;p

   After Shamanic Princess was Gunsmith Cats  which I wasn't really interested
in seeing again so we went down to check out the quiz night to kill time until
Hellsing. The quiz night ended up being the best part of the con. :D

   At first it was going to be me and  Baal  (Pox and Lyndal  had already gone
home) vs.  the  room but one of the  guys at the table next to ours recognised
Baal  from some  jobsearch thing  and they were  kind enough to let  us hijack
their team  (which was  named  "Miffy"  which stood for  something).  I  don't
remember any of their names  (sorry)  aside  from  Emma, who's name I remember
because  she was drawing on her nametag  (that's my excuse and I'm sticking to
it ^^;). Assuming Emma was even her name to begin with and I'm not remembering
wrong. Anyways...  For two  teams  that were both originally  expecting to get
hammered we managed  to  stay second for  most  of the quiz, only slipping  to
third and then  fourth  in  the last  few categories.  Additionally I scored a
Snickers (I don't  like Snickers)  by answering the "What AMV crapped out  the
computer in  the various  programming room" question and Baal scored something
for  the  "How  many  attendees  were  the  AVCon  organizers   prepared  for"
question... Or was it  the  "How  many people actually  attended"  question? I
don't  remember. Also our table won the honor of being in a Mars-bar  (I don't
like Mars-bars) eating  contest because we ended up  with the most candy canes
at our table. They were giving out candy canes as  prizes seemingly at random.
I  didn't  win  the eating  contest, partly  because mars-bars are gross,  and
partly because they stick your mouth up like glue, but  mostly because I don't
like eating infront of strangers... Chewing is embarassing. It was the guy who
recognised Baal that ended up winning... He got a Spawn figure for his trouble
which is not too shabby. Beats Tomb Raider CCG packs anyday. ;)

   I think it's a shame  that I  was so scatterbrained towards the end because
there  were a  few questions that I knew  I  knew  the answer to  but couldn't
remember it. There  were a lot of "Oh  yeah, I knew that"  moments when the MC
read the answers out. I think we could have atleast got third.

   After that I went home and slept and after that I came back for day two...

   All I really wanted to do on day two was watch Love Hina and also check out
Black  Heaven  because  I'd never heared  of  it before. Apart  from that Baal
finished up the DDR trick tournament (didn't win though) and we  just wandered
around until the cosplay/art  awards  thing and  by  "Wandered around"  I mean
"Spent a  lot of time camping the registrations desk watching whatever it  was
they  had  on". After  the awards  doozit  we  were going  to hang around  for
Nadesico but I was burned by then so decided to go home instead.

   I  have to  say though...  The  union cinema is  totally pants, there's  no
denying it. The seats are  uncomfortable  and you've always got someone's head
in your way because there isn't enough hight between the rows. It was a shame.

   I  think  the  biggest let-down about  the whole  con was me  not  having a
digital camera. ;p
