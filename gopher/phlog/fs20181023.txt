that  one time  it, quite spectacularly, did  \________/\________/\___/____/
but  the less  said  about  that  the better
amirite?

   First  thing's first  you  need  to  get  setup! On  Debian,  the  One True
Operating System(tm), you can do this by entering:

      apt-get install ezstream

   You'll need to do this as root or sudoing it or whatever and hitting enter.
Answer yes to anything it asks, who cares, fuck it.

   Once  ezstream  is installed  you  need three things: at  least  one mp3, a
playlist to tell ezstream where the mp3  is and  an  XML file to tell ezstream
what to do with the playlist.

   The  below is my methodology but once you  see how  it works you can figure
out how to work it best for you.

   A bit  of background on why I do it like I do: during the week, the OpenMic
blocks fall  right in the middle of the work day  for me so it's  not possible
for me to stream from the rig I use for LOW WIRE or from Butt or anything like
that so I set up ezstream on baud.baby to just punch out a couple tunes when I
had  the chance. This itself posed two  new problems,  none of my  music is on
baud.baby and it's  not  appropriate to just throw  everything I  like into  a
playlist  because OpenMic is shared with other  DJs. This method  is how  I've
found to work around  this,  it's clumsy but  my best work is  clumsy so let's
proceed.

   Firstly let's set up the XML. This has all the  info ezstream needs to tell
it what to play, to where and how to describe it. Mine is saved in openmic/ as
openmic.xml and looks thusly:

      <ezstream>
         <url>http://anonradio.net:8010/openmic</url>
         <sourceuser>openmic</sourceuser>
         <sourcepassword>s8pF3mrKgms</sourcepassword>
         <format>MP3</format>
         <filename>/home/cat/openmic/playlist.m3u</filename>
         <stream_once>1</stream_once>
         <svrinfoname>aNONradio OpenMic</svrinfoname>
         <svrinfourl>http://www.anonradio.net</svrinfourl>
         <svrinfogenre>Unix</svrinfogenre>
         <svrinfodescription>Official underground radio of the SDF Public
            Access Unix System</svrinfodescription>
         <svrinfobitrate>192</svrinfobitrate>
         <svrinfochannels>2</svrinfochannels>
         <svrinfosamplerate>44100</svrinfosamplerate>
         <svrinfopublic>0</svrinfopublic>
      </ezstream>


   It should be mostly self-explanatory but two things to note: first the .m3u
is  the  playlist  we're  going  to  generate  in step three  so make sure you
remember where you're  going to put  it  and what it's  called. You can always
edit the .XML if you need to change it but I found it was really cumbersome to
edit  the  XML each time I had  a new playlist so  my  tip is  make it  really
generic  and just  mess with the playlist  to change  files.  If  you  have  a
playlist you like and want to keep you can always make a copy into a different
file.

   The  other thing to note is the <stream_once>  setting, if that's set  to 0
ezstream will just play the playlist until you exit it which is funny  but not
cricket.

   Secondly  let's  add our  mp3. On  baud.baby I have an ezstream/  directory
where I  put all the mp3s I'd like  to play, as well as  the playlist and  XML
files, there's  a subdirectory  in there called  stream/ which is the files  I
want to send to the stream. So let's say for example in ezstream/ I have Simon
Boswell's  excellent  "Diskette"   from  the   Hackers  soundtrack   saved  as
diskette.mp3 and I want to play it on OpenMic. I move the file to stream/ with
the command:

      rm stream/* && mv diskette.mp3 stream/

   I  use  rm  at the  start  to remove whatever files  are  in  the directory
already, otherwise they'll be added to the playlist too in the next step.  You
have to exercise a bit of  discipline with  this  to ensure you're not leaving
files in stream/ that  you  haven't streamed yet but it's easy to maintain, if
you're  worried about  it then as  an  alternative  you could  probably use mv
stream/* ~/openmic/ && whatever  at the start so anything in stream/ is dumped
back in to  openmic/ before the  new file  is  moved  in.  Note: all of  these
commands and the  below assume you're in the openmic/ directory - I'm sure you
could do  it from most anywhere but your  CLI-fu might need to  be better than
mine.

   Now we've  got  our  file  where we want  it, next step is  to populate the
playlist. I do  this  with  the  following  command,  again from the  openmic/
directory:

      ls -d -1 stream/* | shuf > playlist.m3u && cat playlist.m3u

   The -d argument on ls makes  it include the directory name and the -1 makes
only one item print per line, that gives us a list of all our files in /stream
which is then piped to shuf  to randomize the  list, you can omit  this bit, I
just do it to mix things up a bit,  then the greater-than symbol redirects the
output  of shuf into the playlist.m3u  file and finally cat playlist.m3u  just
prints the new, shuffled  playlist for a quick eyes-on to make sure everything
looks ok.

   Still with me?

   The last step is two parts,  part one is get your ass on  com  and into the
anonradio  room  or onto IRC's #aNONradio  room and announce  you're going  to
stream  or coordinate with  other streamers. Technically  optional  but you've
gotta treat the other streamers with respect and not  be an asshat, we're  all
there just to share and have a good time.

   Part the second is, when you're ready to stream you blast your playlist out
with the command:

      ezstream -c openmic.xml

   Again, I'm doing this  from the openmic/ directory. You  should see  it say
it's  connected to  the server we  put  in <url>  in  the XML  and  that  it's
streaming your file. If it gives you an error saying that it could not connect
and  you're  sure  the XML  is correct then  it  could  be  someone is already
streaming.

   But you'd know that.

   Because you're in com or the IRC channel, right?

   So  that's the long and  short of it, configure my shit,  dump  files in  a
directory, move what I  want to play into  the stream/ directory,  spit  out a
playlist and  stream it to  the  OpenMic mountpoint. Easy peasy for  me-sy and
people stronger than me  will no doubt be  able  to simplify it even  further,
I've fiddled with stringing it all  together  like  rm && mv && ls && ezstream
all in one line but it got  a bit cumbersome when using a  lagged to heck web-
SSH client  from work. You could also  look at aliasing some stuff, to make it
easier but I haven't had the time to play with that yet.

   Hope that helps and hope to see some new faces on OpenMic! Cat out.
