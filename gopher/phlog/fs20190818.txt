headliner,  who is  on  his  bucket list  of  \________/\________/\___/____/
artists he wants to see live before he dies.
Everything feels  normal, save for the security guard who reeks of alcohol  we
observe  j-walk across the street to yell some  nonsense  at  a man  running a
French creperie before the doors open.

   WE WENT INTO THIS KNOWING NOTHING ABOUT THE OTHER SUPPORTING ACTS. BIG MISS
STEAK!

   Suldusk – Really cool dark  folk/black metal sort of deal.  The lead singer
is a tiny fairy  of a person  and she's  very charming. It's the bass  players
first gig and he's all  dressed  up in  his  black button up and black slacks,
it's  very cute.  They ruled,  super like-able and very talented. I  buy their
T-shirt. The  crowd is much smaller than what  they deserve, but it's only the
first act. We notice 3 people off  to  the  side  in  front  of the  stage are
absolutely plastered staggering drunk. It's 8pm. They kinda look a little off,
like they may be a bit handicapped or something, but we pay no mind, there's a
bar connected to the place after all, they're allowed to be here.

   Volkmar – This is  when things started to get weird. Imagine every socially
awkward alt outcast who hated  everyone sitting  in the back of  your  English
class and put them in  a talent show  act.  The type who would hiss at you and
hail Satan. The  lead  singer was a  middle-aged  man wearing  sunglasses  and
leather pants with matching leather gloves, dyed black hair. Very embarrassing
right off the bat, super edgy singing about Alice in wonderland as an allegory
for drugs, etc. They even had a super nervous lady violinist who was doing her
best but knew half of the audience was probably laughing at them. We've dubbed
the  staggering  drunk trio the  "potato  people" and they are  in  full swing
dancing in front of the stage. Two of them start moshing with each other.  The
band was not  good, but I  always try to support the underdog. I  complimented
the main guy after because I felt bad.

   Bordel Militaire – I was excited for this act when they started bringing up
4   different  synthesizers  during  setup  because   ya  girl  loves  a  good
experimental noise  act. They bring out a flag  for  their group I guess which
had a pair of crossed cocktail glasses on it? They were a weird bunch, members
consisted of an older gentleman, a younger long-haired fellow clearly into the
experimental scene (they  have a look), and two tumblr kids. The music started
out good,  but  the audio  feed for the microphones was  indistinguishable. It
literally just  sounded like  noise,  but not  good, coherent noise. They were
trying to  sing but you couldn't hear  any of it. They spent a majority of the
show desperately trying to get it working and trying to communicate with us to
see if what they  were saying  was understandable. Nobody really knew what was
going on at this  point. The  older guy  and  the long-haired  dude were hyper
focused in the music, because they didn't need to sing, so that part was good.
But the  tumblr-looking kids just  continued to make.....sounds. I don't  know
how to describe what it sounded like, just a completely distorted mess. It was
confusing. At one point someone's  father (I'm assuming) with sunglasses comes
on stage  looking  like an  Elvis impersonator, and I guess  he was  a special
guest for a track? Couldn't hear shit. They finally got the audio feed working
properly and we could hear them for the last 30 seconds LOL.

   Bain Wolfkind – At this point the stage is trashed because these messy kids
had  left all their....paperwork?  Lyrics? And trash strewn  on  it. It took a
long time for them to set up equipment this time because the  only man running
the  audio/lights/everything literally just  looked like  someone's  dad who'd
just wandered in. If you go to a lot of these smaller gigs you get the idea of
how all these  people look, this guy  did not belong  here and clearly  had no
idea what he  was doing.  So we're waiting, yeah?  And I shit you fucking not,
the old goth  man  from  the  talent show  act has  CHANGED HIS  SHIRT  and is
standing on  stage with  a guitar. I'm blown away.  After  what felt  like  30
minutes, he and the Elvis  impersonator are  ready. I guess they are  the act.
Someone comes up to us and asks "Are they Danish?"  ????? We have no idea  who
these  people are. They are very  drunk and start  singing very obscene lyrics
about  choking women and at one point  Elvis has  proceeded to  stick his hand
down his  pants  and  I  FEEL UNSAFE. The potato people are grinding  on  each
other.  I  can't even watch at this  point and I turn around and  ask the lady
behind me if this is a real legit act for this show. She doesn't respond. It's
all  very  disturbing but everyone is shitfaced and dancing.  We haven't had a
lick of  alcohol and  just watch in  horror as things fall  apart.  Elvis  man
doesn't  know the lyrics to  his own songs and  keeps  looking  at  a stack of
papers on  the floor  of the  stage, feels like some  weird perverted  karaoke
night for old folks. We have a  google and apparently Elvis was in a band once
so  maybe  people know who he  is,  but  his entire  musical  schtick is being
offensive and disgusting, apparently. I have to  come  to the  conclusion that
everyone  must  know  each  other  and  we  aren't  in on  the  joke.  I  feel
increasingly bad for the headliner & opening act.

   Of The Wand And The Moon – He comes onto this  filthy  stage looking normal
as fuck compared to every single person who has been up there. Everyone at the
bar is loud as shit because  they  don't care and only about  half  of us have
crowded to the  front to see him. There are some die-hard  fans like Cat here,
we have all patiently waited to see this guy through  the absolute train wreck
that was  the middle of  the show. The lead tumblr kid from  the  other act is
right in front,  shoving his  phone at the  man for the entire  show,  swaying
constantly  and  I  think he  must be on  drugs.  WandMoon tries very hard  to
communicate  with us,  someone asks him to tell a joke and he mentions  how he
can't wait for this night to end. Everyone disagrees, we feel for him, he gets
flustered. He thanks the embarrassing old goth from the other two acts who  is
apparently responsible for bringing him out here. He puts on a great show, but
we  are exhausted  from the absolute clownery that has  ensued. At the end  he
politely explains he is finished and leaves the stage. The  belligerent drunks
beg for  an encore and they aren't leaving. Old Goth literally chases him back
stage to beg for more. We give up, and we  hope he has, too. On the way to the
tram stop I hear him come back on and say "...seriously?"

   It's  nearly 1am. Outside the sidewalks are crawling with  club-goers. Also
everyone looks  really weird?? Everyone  just  looks OFF.  We feel  alien.  We
finally catch a tram back into downtown and decide that there must be a reason
we've never been to that  venue before, and that  crossing Johnson street is a
mistake. THE END.
