   I  read  about  the  Zello  software   on  /        _/         /         /
xiled's  phlog, and was curious to know what  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
public channels  he was  lurking on.  I  was    /        \/        \/    /   \
struggling to  find  any active  one  having   /        _/         /_       _/
constructive    (or    even   civil    haha)  /-        /        _/         /
conversations,  I  found a  few  with active  \________/\________/\___/____/
users but they either had no one talking, or
were  just trolling spam and station announcements.  I was just about to shoot
him an email when I found an active trucker CB and it's very neat.

   It's a really interesting mechanism. I've seen a similar thing  used before
in LINE  messenger that's really popular with the Asian  population  here,  It
lets you leave voice messages for each other to carry  on a voice conversation
asynchronously, though I'm not sure  it has similar group channels. It's  also
cool  to have a way  to go back and listen  to messages you didn't catch and I
like being able to tune in to multiple public channels at once.

   I never imagined there'd be a crossover between  that and the amateur radio
community but hearing it in action it makes a lot of sense.

   I like the idea of  having music in  the background playing over it too, as
xiled suggested,  it reminds  me  of youarelistening.to and soma.fm's  Mission
Control. Way into it.

   Took a quick look at the API too, wonder what I can do with it.
