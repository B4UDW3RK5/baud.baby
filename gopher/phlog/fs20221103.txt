   do you know why of all the nicknames I've  /        _/         /         / 
used  the  name "cat"  stuck?  well it's not  \_______/_\___/____/\___/____/_
because I'm cuddly  and look cute in photos.    /        \/        \/    /   \
it's  because  I was feral. it's  because  I   /        _/         /_       _/
would saunter around with my tail in the air  /-        /        _/         /
so  the  whole  world   had to  look  at  my  \________/\________/\___/____/
asshole.  it's because  when I  crossed your
path you had the worst luck.  it's because I hissed when I spoke. it's because
I would break things for fun and if I was bored I  would fuck with you until I
lost interest or you stoped moving.

   a three letter handle, one syllable like whip-crack, never has something so
simple spoken such volumes about a person.

   they talk about black hat hackers  and white hat hackers,  well I was Vanta
Black.  a  nihilist.  the only thing that  excited  me  was  mutually  assured
destruction and the only thing I wanted to create was wreckage.  my head was a
wasp factory and all that mattered to me was that I was entertained.

   a few weeks back I let that animal out of it's cage because someone had the
audacity to level a threat at people I care about.  I shelved my moral compass
and it was cathartic  and exhilarating  to be reminded,  even for a second, of
who I was and how powerful I felt.
