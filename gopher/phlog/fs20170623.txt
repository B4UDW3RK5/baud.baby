   We're closing in on Independence  Day and
that  means  almost a year  since Danielle and I were last in Washington and I
really miss it. I miss the friends  and family over there, I miss the food and
the beer. I  miss  the weather, but we were up there for Summer and I'm sure a
Pacific North West winter would SAD  me into oblivion.  I miss the attitude of
Americans and I miss how welcoming and unpretentious everyone was.

   I miss slouching  around  the mall with  an Orange Julius, I miss  standing
ankle-deep in crystal clear river waters. I miss the  smell of  pines and firs
and the sound of birds I don't recognise.

   I miss nothing better to do so sleep 'til noon, I miss 8,000 miles  between
me and the office.
