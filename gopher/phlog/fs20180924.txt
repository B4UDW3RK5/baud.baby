   LOW  WIRE  continues   on  with  moderate  \________/\________/\___/____/
success, I'm  three  shows in  now  and I've
started fiddling  with DJ software  and  my playlists  are getting a bit  more
interesting.  I  was really  proud of the  Japanese  Grime show I did the week
before  last but it didn't  archive, this past Saturday  was a  good  one  too
though. Next week I'm gonna get back  to  a  more simple playlist  rather than
clumsily trying to do a mix and just a no-fuss genre.

   The last show  really stressed me the hell out, I dunno why I was so worked
up about it but god damn I had a  whole mess of nightmares the night before. I
dreamt I was ready to go then time slipped and I was 15 minutes late, I dreamt
I was ready  to go and suddenly all my gear  was fucking up, I  dreamt  I  was
trying  to get  ready to go and  people kept  getting in  my  way or otherwise
wasting my time. It was gruelling. What the fuck.

   I dunno man. Had  black-brain all week and I guess it just  came to a head.
Whatever!

   It might  not be there at the time  of  posting  this  file  but  today  or
tomorrow I should have the track lists mirrored on baud.baby for ya.

   In  other  fun audio  news,  Solderpunk  mentioned  on Mastodon  and  later
wrote[1]  about how  tuning in to shortwave during his  first  S24O  overnight
camping ride got gears  turning (heh)  about a radio/found  sound recording in
the vein of my  K6MWT recordings[2] which  in turn got cylinders firing for me
again. I've been trying to stay active  on aNONradio's OpenMic blocks, usually
these happen while I'm at work so I  do  what I can to stream  remotely but it
was  Sunday that I  started  properly thinking about retrying the K6MWT stuff,
with a few new tools under my belt,  and thought it'd be fun to try and stream
it live over the OpenMic stream.

   I  did  a test and  the results were  really  wild, using  the  same  music
generator I used in the old recordings (Drone  FX) and the same K6MWT repeater
but I also threw  a phone call from my Touchfone 12,  behind some reverb  into
the mix. It got me really excited to experiment. I threw a recording  of it[3]
into files/K6MWT/ but just a  heads-up,  the audio is pretty quiet. This seems
to  be my curse,  I struggle with the  same problem  with the mic in LOW WIRE.
Maybe if I keep it up it'll eventually become endearing. Just crank the volume
up, it'll be fine.

   You can hear me giggling at how great it sounds.

   To tie it all together and  make recordings  or  send streams I'm  using  a
program  called Audio Hijack, I use it for LOW WIRE too, I  had it set up with
Chrome,  X-Lite and VLC as  inputs,  with  Chrome  running  Drone  FX,  X-Lite
handling the call and VLC playing the Broadcastify stream of K6MWT.

                                           For  the stream  itself  I  fiddled
  _[Advertisement]__________________    with it a bit and  that's where things
 |                                  |   fell  apart  a  bit.  I  purchased the
 |   Getting tired of this phlog?   |   desktop   version  of  Drone  FX   and
 |                                  |   swapped Chrome  out  for  it in  Audio
 |      Turn to aNONradio.net       |   Hijack  and,  I  dunno,  results  were
 |      on Fridays @ 0100 UTC       |   pretty  bad.  You can hear  it at  the
 |              and                 |   start of the recording below,  it gets
 |                                  |   like stuck on a sound and just buzzes.
 |    CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE!    |   I  dunno  if  it's  because  it's  not
 |                                  |   optimised for newer Macs  or  if maybe
  ----------------------------------    it  just  didn't  like  the  load   my
                                        machine was under, I'm not sure.  I'll
fiddle  with it some more. It wasn't  expensive so I'm not hugely  fussed  but
it's disappointing because I'd like to have Chrome freed up as an input.

   The hams on K6MWT were mostly just jamming the repeater with music,  it was
less weird and more tedious  and silly so I just  started throwing things into
the  mix. I read  some Jared Hendrickson,  played a clip of him  too, and just
read  some  stuff that was  on screen through the phone transmitter.  I played
some  DTMF tones, some of a HAARP  transmission, a voicemail  from  who  knows
where and anything  else  interesting that I could find lying around. It ended
up a  bit of a mess overall but it was fun  to pull at threads of ideas to see
what worked and what didn't.

   I've already  got some  ideas of other  things  I want to try,  though  for
shorter periods and less ad-hoc so maybe I'll try again this Friday.

   There's  a few things I need  to get a  handle on first,  though: I need to
figure out why Drone FX hates  itself so much and I really want to try messing
with Pure  Data as an alternative. I also need to sort out an input library of
sorts rather than adding and removing things ad-hoc and making a mess, there's
a bit in the  recording  from  Sunday  where you can hear some  music break in
because  I was looking for something in Chrome and Chrome was feeding the mix.
With a fixed set of "instruments" it should make it  easier for me to put in a
proper effort to get the volume correct.

   I put a trimmed version of the  OpenMic archive[4] into files/K6MWT/ for ya
too. Feels good to find a creative outlet again, it's been a while.

   One last story  while I've got ya,  since  it's also  audio related. A  few
years back now I picked up a bunch of second hand audio tapes from Goodwill to
make mixtapes on, it fizzled out because the recorder I bought  wasn't  so hot
and I didn't want to shell out for a higher quality one but I never got rid of
anything, I just squashed  it  all  away in  the back of the  cupboard. Cut to
today and  I've got a phone pickups  but need something to record them on so I
dig all that out to  see if it'll  do the trick, find batteries slam in a tape
and hit play to check the batteries work.

   I expected to hear music or some dry dictation but instead I get the voices
of two teenage-ish girls doing  a fake radio station, it really made me smile.
A friend and I used to  do  exactly the same back when we were kids,  ours was
called Ted's Radio,  these girls just introduce themselves "Hannah  Hannah and
Cool Kat" but don't mention any kind of clever show name.

   At first I thought it was from back in the 80s  or early 90s because of the
music  they  play  but they  refer to  them as  "oldies" throughout I'm having
trouble  pinning it down. It might just be a case of  raiding the 'rents music
collection. One of the girls yells at her dad at one point  because the record
player stopped working.

   It's a pretty fun  find, I'll hang  on to it and  maybe  blast it  out over
OpenMic one time.

   And I'll be sure to check the rest of the tapes before I try using them.
