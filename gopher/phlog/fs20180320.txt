   Firstly  zlg  has   a   brief  insightful   /        _/         /_       _/
post[1]  about  not  eschewing  the  lessons  /-        /        _/         /
learned from the web just because "Gopher is  \________/\________/\___/____/
not the  web", a  really good point  that  I
admit I'd never really considered. I've definitely been vocal off and on about
leaving Gopher as-is, although  not to the  extreme he  outlines in his  post.
I'll admit, though, that kind of pig-headedness kind of appeals to me  because
turning your nose up at things like ASCII  art  and the  like means I'm  doing
Gopher "wrong" and that makes me happy hahaha.

   I  agree that  if  Gopher  was to  improve, just  dismissing  anything that
resembles the web just because it resembles  the web is  pretty ridiculous. If
you're looking to  improve Gopher  the state of the web probably a pretty good
place to start, though I think I'm still firmly in the Gopher-is-fine-as-it-is
camp. Gopher isn't a dead protocol but  I  feel like  it's  a dead end and any
significant change to  bring it in line with modern web usage runs a very real
risk of  ending up as something  so alien to  current  Gopher users  that  the
appeal will be completely gone[2].

   THAT SAID! I'm not  a developer and I'm not an engineer, I don't understand
the  protocol and don't  really  care to,  I come  at  this  purely  from  the
perspective of a user, so it's quite likely I don't know shit about shit.

   Elsewhere, and I'm pretty late to the party  on these, I'm slightly jealous
of  Auzymoto[3] and kvothe[4] experiencing Serial Experiments Lain and William
Gibson's Sprawl stories  respectively  for the first time haha. It's kind of a
goofy sentiment I  guess to say "this media changed my life" but they're  both
titles that definitely  wound  themselves tight around a lot of what I've done
since. Before I read Neuromancer I really  don't think I read much  at all, it
resonated with me so hard that I wanted to consume more and more.

   IIRC kvothe  mentioned even further back  that they  were  working  through
Sterling's CYBLIB.TXT  that's  hiding in my files/[5] but I'll point out  that
that list is pretty out of date and I'd really recommend checking out Gibson's
Bridge  trilogy;  Virtual  Light, Idoru and  All Tomorrow's Parties.  I think,
maybe  blasphemously IDK, that it's  a much  stronger  series than  the Sprawl
trilogy.

   In other news, in the  wake of the new Gopher spaces popping up I've picked
up a goofy domain for my own (that's a dumb story in itself) but at this point
I'm not  sure how  to use it.  I'm  reluctant to  just mirror  my  SDF  space,
especially the  phlog since I feel like  I  started  this stuff for SDF and it
should stay here, but at  the same time just having a Gopher  space to display
the uptime of the Gopher server or something stupid like that seems like a bit
of a waste haha. I'll think on it. The dumb part is I have a  very  clear idea
of how I want to set up the hardware and  stuff for it but no clear use for it
beyond that hahaha. Oh well. It's worth doing regardless.

   I'm also putting  together a  plan  for  an  hour  show on aNONradio; I was
tossing around the idea on Mastodon and snowdusk made the very good point that
I have nothing to lose  hehehe. I think I  meet  the criteria of "creative and
reliable" and I'm not  shy about breaking the mold a little so hopefully I can
bring something new to the stream. I think I have an interesting concept and a
good  idea  of  the how-to but  frustratingly, although it's  coming  together
really  quickly  I can't start for a couple of months because  I've got travel
coming up. I don't want to run the show for a  few weeks  then be like "OK BYE
SEE YOU IN LIKE TWO MONTHS, here's another hour of Evan Doorbell dot mp3!"
