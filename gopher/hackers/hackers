   Hackers  is a  quick  & punchy  print-and-play  card drafting  &
management card game  for four players, it'll play with  three in a
pinch but four is ideal.

   1. Print  out the  cards, the cardbacks  are optional,  and slip
them in some card sleeves. I recommend  to slip them in in front of
cards from another game for added rigidity.

   2. Gather some friends.

   3. RTFM.

   4. HACK THE PLANET.

   Thanks  to  tomasino,  dokuja,   solderpunk,  jns,  my  Joey
 brendo   and  anyone   else   special  I've   missed  in   the
 Gopher/Gemini/PUBNIX/Tilde world  for inspiring me  every damn
 day. Thanks to a-ko for letting me spam her with ideas that go
 nowhere  (this  one finally  did).  Thanks  to the_gibson  for
 giving  me a  home  on hackers.town.  Thanks  to cDc,  Phrack,
 l0pht, ACiD  and all the  other stuff  that energized me  as a
 youth. Thanks to  David short for Cypher, it  rules. Thanks to
 YTCracker  for being  the soundtrack  while I  put this  thing
 together.  Thanks to  the  cast  & crew  of  the movie,  David
 Bischoff for the expanded lore  in the novelization and cr0bar
 for the parody that I STILL laugh about to this day.

   As always, thank you to you know who and you know who 2. <3
