     On 27  November, due to my  inexperience  with git, 19 months  of drafts, ASCII  and  ANSI
     artwork, half-finished FAX SEX files and all my templates  and notes were completely wiped
     out. All I had left was the  live Gopherspace  and a handfull of Gopherspace  backups. The
     irony of losing everything  during efforts  to prevent  that happening is not lost  on me.
     This repository represents everything that has come since.
